// THE GOVERNANCE SEAM — the host's hook API for an optional governance provider.
//
// Built by S2 of the suite split (docs/suite-split-design.md §5, as amended by
// the independent perimeter review of 2026-08-27 and retriaged against §0's
// threat model). It lives in `src/mcp/` because it ships on the SAME
// plugin-to-plugin api object `external-tools.ts` defines — one directory holds
// the whole boundary another plugin can reach — and because both consultation
// points (`server.ts`, `guarded.ts`) are here too.
//
// ── WHAT CROSSES, AND WHY EACH DIRECTION IS SAFE (§3) ────────────────────────
//
// Exactly two classes of thing cross the seam:
//
//   • CANDIDATES flow OUTWARD. The host tells the provider "a write completed;
//     here are the exact base and proposed bytes". The provider turns that into
//     a proposal. A proposal confers nothing — agents and machinery supply
//     candidates, humans decide.
//   • REFUSALS flow INWARD. The provider answers refuse-or-not, and a refusal
//     can only make the host refuse MORE. Fail closed by construction.
//
// The third hook class — anything that can mutate a write in flight or ASSERT
// acceptance — is what this module must never offer. §5's rule 6 generalises
// it: the seam accepts registrations that can only ADD A REFUSAL, never a
// predicate the host consults for PERMISSION. That is why the session hook
// returns `{code, detail} | null` and not `{live: boolean}`: the type cannot
// express an allow, so a registrant cannot un-refuse a session the host or
// another registrant already refused.
//
// ── WHY THERE IS NO `registerWriteVeto` (condition 8) ───────────────────────
//
// §5 sketched a pre-write veto and named two registrants for it. Both were
// wrong on the code: the fuller accept-transition guard is `acceptTransitionReason`,
// which is HOST-side in `@vault-mcp/core` and already runs on every guarded
// write; the legacy-writer guard is a provider-internal `BaselineStore`
// predicate (`setLegacyWriteGuard`, governor/wiring/wiring.ts) that gates the
// provider's OWN baseline writes and never touches the MCP write path. S2
// searched for a real registrant and found none, so the veto is not built.
// Unused perimeter surface is dead code, and at a perimeter dead code is worse
// than absent code — it is a shape reviewers reason about and nothing proves.
// When a real registrant appears, it lands with its round-trip test.
//
// ── THE SIX RULES, AND WHERE EACH ONE LIVES ─────────────────────────────────
//
//  1. No mutation hooks. The host never reads a hook's return value except a
//     refusal's `{code, detail}` — pinned by tests/seam.test.mjs's source scan
//     over this module's declared return types.
//  2. Refusals fail CLOSED, observers fail OPEN. A throwing session-refusal hook
//     refuses (a hook that cannot answer must not be read as consent); a
//     throwing or hanging observer is logged and the write stands.
//  3. Observers run after the host's own record. `notifyWrite` is called from
//     the executor's post-handler path, after the journal append — nothing a
//     provider does can precede or suppress the host's audit.
//  4. The host works with ZERO hooks registered. Every consultation iterates a
//     possibly-empty list; the standalone host is the vacuous case, not a
//     special one.
//  5. Bytes and identifiers cross, never capabilities. `WriteFacts` carries no
//     callback, no store handle, and no app reference.
//  6. Registration is app-reachable; the registered CLOSURES are not. The hook
//     lists live in a module-private WeakMap keyed by a token no caller holds —
//     the same pattern `governor/wiring/wiring.ts` uses for the accept
//     perimeter. A reachable observer would be a proposal factory callable with
//     forged facts, which is strictly more than the `app.vault` equivalence
//     covers.
//
// ── PLACEMENT AND BUDGETS (condition 5) ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// The session refusal is consulted INSIDE the kernel's queued closure, where
// `sessionLive` was consulted before it — so `WRITE_TIMEOUT_MS` already bounds
// it and a hanging refusal costs the caller a typed timeout rather than a
// wedged queue. Observers are the opposite case: the write has already landed,
// so they are dispatched OFF the caller's result path (`queueMicrotask`, one
// task per hook, every failure caught) and nothing awaits them.
//
// ── REVOCATION (condition 3) ────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every `register*` returns a disposer, and the disposer is the ONLY way to
// revoke. There is no id-addressed `unregisterHook(id)` — the `id` argument is
// diagnostic labelling and an owner LABEL, never an address. An address-based
// revoke is forgeable by anyone holding the api object, which is exactly the
// defect S2 also fixed in `ExternalToolRegistry` (its `unregisterTools(owner)`
// let any caller unhook any publisher's tools).
