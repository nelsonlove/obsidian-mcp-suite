// SESSIONS — the published contract (WP5, D01; suite-split S3, condition 7).
//
// A session binds a connection, a local actor, a base state, a scope, and the
// current replica. D01's ruling shapes everything here: **sessions are
// replica-local** — the identifier is globally unique and may be LINKED
// across devices (`continuedFrom`, `relatedSessions`), but a link transfers
// no capability. Another device opens its OWN session with its own actor
// binding, base state, expiry, and receipts. "An attestation or cohort may be
// portable; the live session capability is not."
//
// Status transitions are one-way. There is no resurrect: an expired or
// revoked session is evidence about the past, and a new session is cheap.
// Expiry is decided AT USE (dequeue, admission) against a caller-supplied
// clock — no timers, nothing here reads the wall clock.
//
// PUBLISHED HERE (@vault-mcp/core) since the suite split's S3 (condition 7,
// ruled 2026-08-27: "the HOST keeps minting... SessionV1 therefore becomes a
// published contract, not provider-internal"). A session is TRANSPORT state —
// the host is the only thing that knows a connection began, it computes the
// connection's scope digest, and it closes the session when the socket
// drops. So `SessionV1`, its status transitions, and its clock-expiry floor
// live here as a contract both plugin artifacts can import; the host's own
// MINTING logic (`openSession`, which needs a host-local uuidv7) stays in the
// plugin at `src/kernel/sessions/session.ts`, and the provider's
// `session-store.ts` (the durable event log and revocation state) stays with
// the provider — only the type and its pure transition helpers moved.
//
// What the PROVIDER owns is REFUSAL: revocation state, answered through the
// seam's refusal-shaped session hook (`registerSessionRefusal`, mcp/seam.ts).
// The host never asks a provider for permission — only whether it wants to
// refuse — and an absent provider constrains nothing.

// The branded session identifier.
