// src/kernel — the pure skills-export core of the vault-skills satellite.
//
// Lineage: written for the standalone obsidian-vault-skills plugin, folded into
// the Governor host as `src/kernel/skills/` (#82, cycle 2), and extracted back
// out to its own plugin at the suite split's S4. The code is the same code; the
// three homes differ only in who mounts it.
//
// Every file here is Obsidian-free: the exporter/transform/transclude compiler
// runs over an injected `SkillsSource` (skills-source.ts). The Obsidian-facing
// adapter and the six tool specs live in ../tools.ts; the pane, commands and
// export-on-save wiring in ../wiring.ts. Nothing here imports `obsidian` or the
// MCP SDK, which is why the whole compiler is unit-tested headlessly.
