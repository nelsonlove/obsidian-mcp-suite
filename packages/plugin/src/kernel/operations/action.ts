// The ACTION contract — Gate 0, WP0.
//
// An action is a stable, versioned semantic contract named by its
// POSTCONDITION: one bounded statement of what becomes true in the vault. It is
// deliberately NOT a tool, a handler, or a UI control. Those are SURFACES —
// doors onto an action — and several of them may open onto the same action.
//
// Why the indirection exists (docs/action-registry.md, "Why the registry is the
// owner"): tool-shaped architecture drifts. A tool acquires a side effect while
// its documentation, safety classification, compact-discovery entry and test
// matrix stay unchanged; or it appears through a second surface that bypasses
// the first surface's wrapper. This repo already has three registration paths
// (the patched `registerTool`, `origRegister` for `obsidian_write_notes` and
// the Code Mode meta-tools, and `mountModules`' registrar), which is exactly
// the shape that drift hides in. Declaring the action ONCE and generating or
// validating every surface from it is what closes that class.
//
// This module is pure data and types. It imports nothing — not `obsidian`, not
// the kernel — so it can be consumed by the registry, by the compatibility
// adapter, by generated projections, and by headless tests alike.
