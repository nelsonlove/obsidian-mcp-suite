// question the triage extraction answered by leaving the seam behind, and it
// has the same forbidden answer: two copies of a rule core is how one vault
// gets two vocabularies. Conformance is itself a planned satellite
// (suite-split-design.md §6), so core is where both consumers end up meeting.

// apply — which is the vocabulary kernel's shape at S7 and has the same
// forbidden answer: two copies of an accept predicate is how one vault gets two
// definitions of "accepted". Behaviour-preserving by construction: every symbol

// for. `vaultSlug` is published for the same class of reason and at its

// absent here" on the machine that is holding the chain.
