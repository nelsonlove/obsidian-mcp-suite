// VAULT FILECLASS — the typed-frontmatter CLI proxy as its own Obsidian plugin.
//
// Published to the Governor host through vault-mcp-api as eight MCP tools:
//
//   vaultmcp_fileclass_list      — every fileClass
//   vaultmcp_fileclass_schema    — a fileClass's options + resolved fields
//   vaultmcp_fileclass_explain   — a note's fileClasses + field values
//   vaultmcp_fileclass_query     — rows for a fileClass, filtered
//   vaultmcp_fileclass_get       — one field's value on a note
//   vaultmcp_fileclass_validate  — schema violations
//   vaultmcp_fileclass_set       — validated single-note field write (MUTATING)
//   vaultmcp_fileclass_set_where — validated bulk write, dry-run by default (MUTATING)
//
// SATELLITE OF THE SUITE (suite-split design §6, "Fileclass CLI proxy | public
// optional | satellite"). Extracted out of the host after the
// quickadd-choices-compile pilot and the vaultmcp-skills (S4), vaultmcp-triage (S5),
// vaultmcp-crosssession (S6) and vaultmcp-vocab / vaultmcp-health / vaultmcp-bases (S7)
// satellites. Consequences of the publishing contract, each deliberate:
//
//   * THE PUBLISHED TOOL NAMES CHANGED — `fileclass_*` became
//     `vaultmcp_fileclass_*`, and the bare names shed the `fileclass_` prefix so
//     nothing publishes as `vaultmcp_fileclass_fileclass_list`. The host publishes
//     an external tool as `<sanitized publisher id>_<bare name>`, so the plugin
//     id IS the tool namespace. Recorded in CLAUDE.md and README.md, not buried
//     here.
//   * THE ALLOWLIST BOUNDARY MOVED TO THE HOST, and after round 2 (2026-09-07)
//     it lands ALMOST where the module's own refusal did — seven of the eight
//     tools refused outright, one scoped. The two READS that name a note call
//     it `note`, which is not a host path key, and the five bulk/engine tools
//     name no note at all: all seven are blocked outright under an active
//     allowlist. `set` calls it `note_path`, which IS a key, so the host scopes
//     that one write per-path AND the kernel's record guard, lock consult and
//     journal target see the note it rewrites. The asymmetry is the decision:
//     a read gains nothing from kernel visibility, a write does. See tools.ts.
//   * REFUSALS THROW; the host renders a thrown error's lowercase-snake `code`
//     as `Error [code]: message`, the envelope the module already produced. ONE
//     envelope changed: a FAILED CLI run used to be `okError` (a report plus
//     `isError: true`), which the boundary cannot express — it now returns the
//     same report with `succeeded: false`. Read `succeeded`, not `isError`.
//   * The host's queue, journal and kernel args still apply — external mutating
//     tools ride the guarded registration path like every built-in, and the
//     host distrusts an external `readOnly: true` claim, so all eight register
//     as mutating unless `vaultmcp-fileclass` is listed in the host's
//     `trustedReadOnlyPlugins`.
//
// THIS PLUGIN NEEDS THE HOST, and it needs two more things besides — which is
// one more silence than any other satellite has. With Governor absent it loads,
// keeps its settings, adopts nothing, and does nothing. With Governor present
// but the Fileclass plugin unloaded, or the `fileclass` CLI binary not found, it
// publishes NOTHING: absent, not broken, which is the gate the module always
// had. The settings tab names whichever of the three states you are in.
//
// THE GATE'S GRAIN CHANGED. As a module it was evaluated per connection build,
// so a session that reconnected after installing the plugin or the binary got
// the tools. Here it is evaluated at publish time — plugin load, and every
// settings write. Installing either without reloading this plugin leaves the
// tools absent until a reload. Same caveat the bases satellite carries, same
// reason, stated in the README and the settings tab rather than left to be
// discovered.

/** The host plugin's ids, CURRENT FIRST — the same pair vault-mcp-api reads, in
 *  the same order, and for the same reason: the host id moved `vault-mcp` →
 *  `governor` at 0.12.0 and back to `vault-mcp` at the suite split's S3c.
 *  Used ONLY to find the settings to adopt from; publishing itself is entirely
 *  vault-mcp-api's business.
 *
 *  THE ORDER AND THE `api` CHECK BELOW ARE BOTH PART OF THE ANSWER. Post-split
 *  `app.plugins.plugins["governor"]` is the governance PROVIDER, which exposes
 *  no `api` object, so a bare-presence match over the old `["governor",
 *  "vault-mcp"]` order resolved the PROVIDER as the host — this satellite would
 *  then have adopted the provider's settings as the host's. The discriminator is
 *  vault-mcp-api's own (`getApi`, packages/vault-mcp-api/src/index.ts): a plugin
 *  counts as the host only if it exposes the api surface.
 *
 *  THE SUITE'S ONE BEHAVIOURAL TEST of this lookup is
 *  `packages/crosssession/tests/host-lookup.test.mjs`, over the extracted
 *  `packages/crosssession/src/host-lookup.ts` — same two lines, same reasoning,
 *  written out in full there. Nine identical suites would be nine copies of one
 *  assertion; a change here belongs in that file too. */
