// GUARDED TERRITORIES — the vault areas Governor must never review, touch, or

//
// Extracted from governor/wiring/wiring.ts the day capture became the second
// consumer. Two hand-copied lists of the same territories would drift, and a
// drifted copy here fails PRIVATE: a prefix present in the pane's list but
// missing from capture's means the pane politely skips a folder while capture
// quietly writes its note bodies to disk. One list, two consumers.
//
// The list itself is this vault's folder names hardcoded — issue #321 tracks
// promoting it to real configuration. Until that lands, this module is the
// single place the names live.
