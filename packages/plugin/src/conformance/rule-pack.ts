// rule-pack.ts — the RulePack contract and the vault snapshot packs run over.
//
// A rule pack is a named producer of Findings over a supplied snapshot — the
// same "rail feeds a listing, pack returns typed findings" contract the module
// findings functions already honor (they are pure over an injected listing).
// The module adapters (packs/) wrap `noteVocabFindings` / `schemeFindings`;
// the ported legacy checks (phase 2) implement `run` directly. No pack reads
// the vault itself — the engine injects the snapshot.
