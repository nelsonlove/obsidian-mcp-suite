/**
 * conformance-sources-guard.test.mjs — #125 item 1.
 *
 * `VaultSnapshot.sources` / `.blueprints` are optional, and every pack that
 * needs them wrote `snapshot.sources ?? []`. A snapshot built WITHOUT a sources
 * listing therefore made those packs report zero findings — indistinguishable
 * from a clean vault, and the ratchet then reports every one of that pack's
 * accepted keys as CLEARED.
 *
 * This is the absence-vs-emptiness class, which by this point has bitten this
 * codebase in four separate subsystems: a missing baseline read as an empty one
 * (#133), an absent quickadd `data.json` reported as CONFORMING (#136), an
 * unparseable frontmatter block read as no frontmatter (#104's residual), and
 * here. The distinction that matters is ABSENT vs EMPTY: `[]` is a real answer
 * ("this vault has no source files") and must keep working; `undefined` is the
 * absence of an answer and must refuse.
