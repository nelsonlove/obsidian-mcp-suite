/**
 * governance-baseline-reconcile.test.mjs — baselines follow their note.
 *
 * The defect: a baseline is keyed by `contentHash(path)`, and a path is a LOCATION, not
 * an identity. Rename or move a note and its acceptance is silently orphaned — the note
 * reads as never-accepted with no error anywhere. Measured on the real vault: 158 of 273
 * baselines had drifted.
 *
 * Two halves, both pinned here: `BaselineStore.rekey` (the primitive, exercised against a
 * fake BlobFs) and `planBaselineReconcile` (the pure decision, which is where every edge
 * case lives). The Obsidian wiring — the `vault.on("rename")` registration and the
 * startup pass — is verified by build + reasoning, the same split governance-live-mount
 * makes.
 *
 * The invariant that matters most, and the reason repointing is legitimate at all: a
 * rekey is a RE-ADDRESSING, never an acceptance. `content`, `hash`, `acceptedAt` and
 * `acceptedBy` must survive it byte-for-byte — if they didn't, this machinery would be
 * forging acceptances nobody gave.
