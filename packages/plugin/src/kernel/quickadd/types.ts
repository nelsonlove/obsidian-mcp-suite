// No `obsidian` import anywhere in

 *  `detectChoiceCycles` in transform.ts, which runs over the whole compiled
 *  set once every note's steps are resolved.
 *

 *  way a choice note's own name is (frontmatter `name:` if it is a non-empty

 *  command stores the referenced choice's name there, not a generic label —
