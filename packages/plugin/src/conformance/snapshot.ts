//
// Frontmatter parsing REUSES @vault-mcp/core's `parseAllFrontmatter` (the same
// best-effort top-level YAML scalar/array reader the filesystem-only server
// uses) — no new dependency, and the same disk-frontmatter semantics the
// Python rail assumed.
//
// Two listings, deliberately:
//   • notes  — .md AND .fileclass, each with {path, frontmatter, body} — the
//     vocab pack's input (types live in .fileclass; glossary in .md bodies).
//   • paths  — .md ONLY — the scheme pack's input (addresses attach to notes).
//
// excludedRoots drops whole subtrees BEFORE any read (the seam that keeps the
// archaeology tree out of the rail, aligned with worker-3's schemes[].excludedRoots).
//
// TERRITORY GUARD (#157): `root` is checked against a declared boundary and a
// hard deny-list BEFORE any of the above happens — see `assertRootPermitted`.

// ── territory guard (#157) ──────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Filed against a real breach: a corpus measurement commissioned for #143
// read `~/obsidian-old` — 12,072 notes, including 2,998 files under
// `80-89 Sensitive/` — to count frontmatter parse failures. Read-only, but the
// standing rule is flat: never `~/obsidian-old`, never `80-89` legal
// material, never anything under a hold.
//
// The bound is applied HERE, before `buildSnapshot` performs a single read —
// filtering the returned snapshot would be useless, because the exposure is
// the file CONTENTS that transit this process, not the aggregate this
// function returns.
//
// Identity is decided over the RESOLVED REAL PATH the filesystem reports,
// never a string prefix — the same technique `cli.ts`'s
// `intendedRealPath`/`isInside` pair uses to decide "is this the protected
// file" for the baseline-identity guard (#144: a string-comparison version of
// that exact question had three live bypasses — a decoupled `--root`, a
// hardlink, and a realpath-fallback that could be forced). Those helpers are
// not exported from `cli.ts`, and `cli.ts`'s baseline/rebaseline guard is live
// PATH IDENTITY IS IMPORTED, NEVER RE-IMPLEMENTED (#169).
//
// `realish`/`isWithin` used to live here as a fresh implementation of the same
// technique, because #144's helpers were unexported and that file is live
// acceptance-path code. They are exported now, so this imports them.
//
// The reason this matters more than ordinary DRY: the string-comparison
// predecessor of this comparison was bypassed THREE separate ways (#144 —
// caller-controlled `root`, hardlink/case alias, and a realpath fallback that
// could fabricate the record). Two copies of a security comparison means two
// places a future bypass has to be fixed, and only one of them will be.
//
// Verified equivalent before collapsing rather than assumed: a differential run
// over 12 path shapes (resolvable and dangling symlinks, a symlink loop, a
// non-existent path, `.`/`..`, the filesystem root) and 6 containment pairs
// found ZERO divergence. "Same technique" is not "same behaviour" — the two
// did differ cosmetically (`resolve` vs `join` on the re-appended basename;
// `isInside` resolves its inputs where `isWithin` assumed pre-resolved ones),
// and `isInside` is the strictly more defensive of the pair.

 *    UNCONDITIONALLY, before the boundary is even consulted, so this holds
 *    even when a boundary was declared that would otherwise have permitted
