// move-with-links.ts — a move that rewrites its own backlinks, without core's
// wait for a clean metadata cache (Nelson's "B", 2026-09-29, relayed:
// "Let's try be and run tests looking for damage").
//
// Why: `app.fileManager.renameFile` runs its link update behind
// `metadataCache.onCleanCache`, which resolves only when no indexing task is in
// progress and the link-resolver queue is empty. With about twenty agent
// sessions writing to the vault all the time that moment rarely comes: a rename
// of a note with no links took 63 s on a quiet vault and 357 s under load, and
// the area moves of 2026-09-29 took 6 to 25 minutes each.
//
// What it does instead:
//   1. FIND every note that may link the note, from its TEXT: every markdown
//      note whose text contains the note's name (as written, `%20`-encoded, or
//      in either Unicode normal form) is read and parsed. The text is always
//      current, so a note written moments before (its index entry still stale —
//      the risk the ruling named) is found like any other, and so are links
//      Obsidian's index does not track (a link inside a frontmatter string). The
//      index (`resolvedLinks`) is used only as a cross-check.
//   2. RENAME at the file level (`vault.rename`), which does not wait.
//   3. REWRITE each note inside `vault.process`, at the planned positions when
//      its text is unchanged, and from its current text otherwise. The moved
//      note's own relative links (markdown or wiki) are rewritten from its new
//      folder.
//   RECORDS (01.44 rule 8) are never rewritten: a note that links the moved note
//   from inside a record keeps its link as written, and the moved note's own
//   links stay as written when it is a record itself. Each link left is reported
//   in `records_left`; it is not damage, so it does not make `ok` false.
//   4. CHECK for damage and report it, never silently: no link may still name
//      the old path unresolved, every note must reach the moved note as often as
//      before, the moved note must reach each of its relative targets as often
//      as before, and every note the index says links it must have been found.
