// ADMISSION SERVICE — the only code allowed to advance standing (WP6, §9).
//
// The isolation is CAPABILITY-SHAPED, not name-shaped: the constructor takes
// a `standingAdvance` closure — compare-and-swap over the standing ref —
// that the wiring builds from the history repository and hands to this
// service alone. The guide is explicit that "a public TypeScript method with
// a suggestive name is not sufficient isolation": nothing here is placed on
// a plugin instance, a view, a command registry, an MCP registry, or a DOM
// property, and the source-scan test enforces that the standing ref's name
// is constructed nowhere outside the refs module, this package, and the one
// wiring point that builds the capability.
//
// The required ordering (§10), each step durable before the next:
//
//   1. revalidate subject and authority   (policy.requireAdmissible, fresh)
//   2. construct and durably store claim  (unattached evidence if we crash)
//   3. compare-and-swap the standing ref  (the actual authority transition)
//   4. append the settlement record       (what happened, for recovery)
//   5. refresh rebuildable projections    (a callback; failures degrade)
//
// A crash between 2 and 3 leaves a retriable claim; between 3 and 4 leaves a
// consistent-but-unrecorded settlement the recovery pass completes. Nothing
// in any window leaves a ref pointing at evidence that does not exist,
// because the claim lands BEFORE the ref moves.
