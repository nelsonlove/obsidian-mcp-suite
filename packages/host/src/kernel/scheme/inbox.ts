// inbox.ts — Stage B of the jd-dashboard fold: the "XX.01 Unsorted/Inbox"
// rollup jd-dashboard's InboxDashboardView showed in a sidebar pane.
//
// Ported from obsidian-jd-dashboard/src/scanner.ts's `scanInboxes` (area/
// category/id folder-shape regexes carried over VERBATIM: AREA_RE, CATEGORY_RE,
// ID_RE, the ".01" + "Unsorted"/"Inbox" title-prefix test, and scanInboxes's
// own inline cover-note/dot-file/+README exclusion — NOT `isCoverNote`, a
// different function in the original file used only by its drift scanner),
// but reworked from an `app.vault` TFolder tree
// walk to operate purely over a flat markdown-path listing — same "pure, no
// obsidian import" discipline as the rest of this directory (findings.ts,
// jd.ts). This is genuinely a scope-provider-shaped question ("what's in this
// address prefix") but is written as a self-contained function rather than
// through `ScopeProvider.membersOf`/`expectedFolder`: those two answer "what
// notes carry an address under scope S" and "what folder should THIS address's
// OWN note live in" respectively — neither answers "what is the actual vault
// folder path of a specific `.01` id, so its contents can be counted", because
// an id's own folder is deliberately not a `membersOf`-style scope container
// (jd.ts's scopesAlongPath: "an id/fractal-id folder — an id's own
// attachment-folder, not a new scope container"). Extending the ScopeProvider
// interface for this one pane's sake would touch jd.ts, a shared, tested,
// load-bearing file, for a feature only this module needs — so `.01`
// = "Inbox" (also named as such in the `vaultmcp-jd-scaffold` satellite's
// `src/kernel/standard-zeros.ts` ZeroSpec table — it was this plugin's
// `kernel/jd-scaffold/` until the mutating-tier extraction) is treated as
// JD-domain knowledge local to this file,
// matching the precedent of category-index.ts's own local ID_RE.
//
// Counting-fidelity note: the original counts DIRECT TFolder children (files
// AND subfolders, one level deep, so a subfolder counts as "1" regardless of
// what — or how much — is inside it, and non-markdown attachments count too),
// excluding the cover note, any dot-prefixed name, and any name containing
// "+README" (a documented legacy-leftover exclusion). This module only ever
// sees markdown note paths, so it approximates the TFolder count by counting
// DISTINCT direct entry names under the inbox folder — a bare filename for a
// note directly in the folder, or a subfolder's own name (deduped) for
// anything nested one or more levels deeper — applying the same cover-note/
// dot-file/+README exclusions to that name set. This still undercounts versus
// the original in two ways, both accepted as the fold's known reduction: a
// non-markdown attachment sitting directly in the inbox folder is invisible,
// and an entirely-empty subfolder (no markdown notes anywhere inside it) is
// invisible. Everything else — which folder counts as which item, the three
// exclusions, the busiest-first sort, the area grouping — matches the
// original exactly.
//
// This function does NOT filter by a scheme instance's `excludedRoots` —
// that is the wiring layer's job (scheme/wiring.ts), applied to the `notes`
// listing BEFORE it reaches this function, so an excluded root is invisible
// to both discovery and counting here without this pure function needing to
// know about scheme instances at all.
