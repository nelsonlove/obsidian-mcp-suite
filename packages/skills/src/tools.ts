// tools.ts — the vault-skills satellite's tool surface. Six tools, published to
// the Governor host through `vault-mcp-api` (see main.ts):
//
//   vault_skills_validate — collect + transform, report errors/warnings/counts (read-only)
//   vault_skills_tree     — the agent/skill hierarchy (read-only)
//   vault_skills_preview  — the compiled output diffed against the export dir (read-only)
//   vault_skills_export   — materialize the Claude Code plugin to disk (mutating)
//   vault_skills_release  — export into a repo dir + stamp a version (mutating)
//   vault_skills_mark     — mark a note skill/agent/policy/command in its frontmatter (mutating)
//
// THE PUBLISHED NAMES ARE UNCHANGED. Each spec's `name` here is the bare half
// (`validate`, `tree`, …); the host publishes it as `<sanitized plugin id>_<name>`,
// and this plugin's id is `vault-skills`, which sanitizes to `vault_skills`. So
// the wire names stay exactly `vault_skills_validate` … `vault_skills_mark`.
// That is deliberate and load-bearing: renaming shipped tool names breaks agent
// sessions for zero semantic gain (the host's own locked-decision precedent for
// `governance_revisions` / `governance_submit_revision`).
//
// The three read tools compile the vault through the pure exporter core
// (./kernel/*, Obsidian-free over an injected SkillsSource). The export
// product stays MATERIALIZE-TO-DISK — the tool triggers a write to the
// configured output dir; Claude Code loads the skills off disk. That contract
// is unchanged from the standalone plugin and from the folded-into-the-host era.
//
// ── Envelope convention (the satellite contract) ─────────────────────────────
//
// A handler returns PLAIN DATA and THROWS on refusal. The host wraps the return
// value in `ok()` and a thrown error in `fail()`, so the envelopes agents see
// are byte-compatible with the folded era's — but the `ok`/`fail` helpers
// themselves are host-internal and no longer imported here.
//
// ── The one load-bearing security requirement (accept guard) ─────────────────
//
// `vault_skills_mark` writes note frontmatter, so it MUST route through the
// accept-forbidden guard like every other vault write: a skills-mark can NOT
// introduce or change an `accepted` / `accepted-by` / `accepted-on` field, or
// set `acceptance-status` to an accepted value. Acceptance is a human gesture
// only, in no API. This plugin contributes NO accept/approve tool, and the mark
// path runs the SAME `acceptTransitionReason` predicate the fs / Obsidian write
// primitives use (@vault-mcp/core), in `guardSkillsMark` below — pinned by
// tests/skills-module.test.mjs. Extraction did not weaken it: the predicate is
// a published core contract, not a host-private one.
//
// Obsidian-free by construction: vault state arrives through the injected
// SkillsBackend (structurally typed), so every handler and the mark guard are
// unit-testable headlessly. The Obsidian adapter is `obsidianSkillsBackend(app)`
// — the only vault coupling for skills.
