/**
 * governance-module.test.mjs — THE ACCEPT-UNREACHABILITY TRIPWIRE, now inside the provider.
 *
 * It asserts, with the accept surface actually present in the source tree, that NONE of
 * performAccept / setBaseline / runGuardedAdopt / setClassEnabled / stampAcceptedFrontmatter is
 * reachable from any of:
 *   - the plugin instance (no instance method / no this.<member>),
 *   - the view/tab instance (controller held in a module-private WeakMap),
 *   - the settings tab (it hands over a container and receives nothing),
 *   - this plugin's published agent-facing tool surface (src/tools/*.ts + main.ts's publishTools
 *     call), which never names an accept-path callable,
 * and that every pane Accept/Revert/Adopt/allowlist/authority button is addEventListener-wired (so
 * its `.onclick` stays null) and gates on isRealGesture. The DEFINITIVE proof is the deploy-time
 * LIVE reachability walk (pane.ts/wiring.ts import the obsidian runtime, types-only in the test
 * env, so the classes cannot be instantiated headlessly); this source-level tripwire is what
 * catches a regression BEFORE that live check.
 *
 * ── WHAT S3c DID TO THIS FILE, AND WHY EACH DELETION IS NOT A THINNING ──────────────────────
 *
 * THE ACCEPTANCE MODULE NO LONGER EXISTS. It left the host's module registry entirely: it never
 * contributed an MCP tool (its registrar was a no-op on the transport), and all it ever carried
 * was an `enabled` flag and a config block for a pane that lived somewhere else. Both halves are
 * this package's own now — `src/settings.ts` (`GovernorSettings.enabled` / `.config`, read from
 * the same `data.json` the pre-split plugin wrote) and `src/settings-tab.ts`.
 *
 * So the module-registry half of the old tripwire — "declared as a capability module, default off",
 * "contributes ZERO MCP tools when enabled", "collect() renders a config section", "the registry
 * REFUSES a governance-shaped module", "mountHost's ctx is {getSettings, visible} only" — is not
 * weakened here, it is UNSTATEABLE here: there is no module row, no manifest, no `collect()`, no
 * mount host and no `fake-server.mjs` in this package. The host's side of the fact is pinned where
 * it belongs, in `packages/host/tests/modules-mount.test.mjs`: a surviving `modules.acceptance` row
 * is an UNKNOWN id, reported as a problem and never mounted. Reproducing a host assertion from a
 * package that cannot import the host is how a suite grows two copies of one claim that drift.
 *
 * Each removed block carries its reason inline below, at the point where it used to sit, so a
 * reader diffing against the pre-split file finds the accounting rather than a hole.
 *
 * ── INSTRUMENT DISCIPLINE ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Every scan in this file is exercised against a planted violation before it is trusted against
 * the real tree. A source scan that silently matches nothing is worse than no scan: it reads as
 * coverage in the suite output while asserting the empty set.
 *
 * Headless: this file imports only pure provider modules (`kernel/settings.ts`,
 * `kernel/dispositions.ts`, `tools/pending-review.ts`) — none of which needs the obsidian runtime.

// no seam call to the provider, deliberately: its comment says the provider
// "watches the journal file it already read and no longer needs the host to tell
// it the file grew". THE PROVIDER DOES NOT DO THAT. `nudgeGovernanceQueue` has
// exactly one caller in this package (`refreshProjections`, on the admission
// path), and `wiring.ts` registers no watcher over `deps.journalDir`. So #261's
