// obsidian_cli — proxy to the official Obsidian CLI, closing the breadth gap
// (file history/diff/restore, themes, snippets, plugin install/uninstall,
// publish, …) without hand-writing a native tool per command. The CLI binary
// is Obsidian's single-instance forwarder: it IPCs the command into this very
// Obsidian process, so it only works while Obsidian is running — which is
// guaranteed here, since this plugin *is* Obsidian.
//
// Safety model:
//   - annotations.readOnlyHint: false → read-only mode blocks the tool wholesale
//     (the guard can't know which CLI commands mutate; assume all do).
//   - CLI args can't be path-scoped, so the tool refuses to run while a path
//     allowlist is active — the same policy as unscopable external tools.
//   - Dangerous commands (eval, dev:*, devtools, restart, reload, command,
//     plugins:restrict) are refused unless the "Allow dangerous CLI commands"
//     plugin setting is on. `eval` and `dev:cdp` are full JS execution inside
//     Obsidian's Electron process — the gate defaults off.
//   - The vault is pinned to THIS vault (`vault=<name>` is always the first
//     arg); a caller-supplied vault param is rejected, so a session can never
//     cross into another vault through the proxy.
//   - Accept-forbidden guard (cliAcceptRefusal): the scar "the accept verb goes
//     in no API" is enforced at the MCP note-write primitive, and the CLI proxy
//     would otherwise bypass it. property:set and content writes (create/append/

//     cannot be inspected — DENIED BY DEFAULT via the command policy
//     (cli-policy.ts), re-enabled only per-command through human-only settings.
//   - Command policy (cli-policy.ts): a settings deny list (always wins) plus
//     the deny-by-default opaque-accept set above; refusals are typed
//     Error [cli_denied] and run before the danger gate, which still applies.

//
// The scar "the accept verb goes in no API" is enforced at the MCP note-write
// primitive (write-notes-compose.ts / obsidian-backend.ts). obsidian_cli proxies
// ~104 CLI commands straight past that primitive, so acceptance could be written
// through the CLI: `property:set name=acceptance-status value=accepted`, or a
// create/append/prepend whose content carries an `accepted` frontmatter fence.
// We reuse the SAME rule (`acceptForbiddenReason`, over the same deep
// accepted-family detector) here, BEFORE the command runs — no second definition
// of "accepted". A CLI property set / content write is always an INTRODUCE (the
// CLI path has no "carry an existing human-granted value forward" expression),
// so the introduce check is exactly right.
//
// RESIDUAL — CLOSED on both fronts, two mechanisms that compose:
//   • The opaque macro/code commands (`quickadd`/`quickadd:run`/
//     `quickadd:run-template`/`eval`/`command`) can set acceptance where no
//     guard can inspect — DENIED BY DEFAULT by the command policy
//     (cli-policy.ts), re-enabled only per-command through the human-only
//     `cliPolicy.allowOpaque` setting; a re-enabled `eval` still needs
//     allowDangerousCli.
//   • `create template=<t>` draws frontmatter from a template note the params
//     only NAME. The template guard below resolves and reads it and applies
//     the same rule pre-exec (unresolvable fails closed). It refuses a template
//     carrying a literal accepted fence (the STATIC case), AND — the post-scan
//     expansion hole this once left open (#137) — it now FAILS CLOSED on any
//     expansion token in the resolved bytes: a Templater `<%` opener OR a
//     core-Templates `{{` field opener.
//
//     Why the expansion check is needed: Obsidian expands both Templater `<% %>`
//     tags and core Templates `{{date:FMT}}`/`{{time:FMT}}` fields AFTER a byte
//     scan, and BOTH honor moment's `[…]` literal escape — so an expansion could
//     emit both the acceptance assertion and the fence characters from a
//     template that contains neither, and the scanned bytes would not be the
//     landed bytes (the #126 defect shape one level up). The `create template=`
//     path uses the core Templates plugin specifically, so `{{date:FMT}}` is a
//     live arbitrary-emission facility on exactly this surface — carving it out
//     was the flaw. Because the expanded output cannot be inspected pre-render, a
//     template carrying ANY expansion token is refused outright
//     (`templateExpansionRefusal`, below) rather than scanned and trusted. The
//     static scan remains for templates with no expansion token but a literal
//     fence.
//
//     A re-enabled `quickadd:run-template` gets the same checks on its `path=`
//     template. It remains in the policy's default-deny set regardless, because
//     QuickAdd's own runtime-computed frontmatter (distinct from the template
//     file's bytes) stays opaque.

// ── the CLI content path decides over EVERY plausible reading (#153) ──────────
//
// The CLI un-escapes a param value's backslash escapes before the vault sees
// them, so — unlike every other accept-guard caller — this one cannot inspect
// the bytes it was handed. It must RECONSTRUCT the document that will land, and
// a reconstruction models another program's escape semantics. #146's review
// found that model incomplete: it had no notion of an ESCAPED BACKSLASH (`\\`),
// so a crafted payload could make the guard perceive the frontmatter fence
// ending in a different place than the honored document has it — hiding an
// acceptance assertion inside the real fence from the guard's view.
//
// Settling "which escape semantics does the shipped CLI use?" is a property of
// an external binary and was left unsettled (#153). Rather than bet the crown-
// jewel accept boundary on guessing right, we DO NOT PICK a reading. We enumerate
// the plausible readings, expand under EACH, and REFUSE (fail closed) if ANY
// reading yields an acceptance assertion inside a frontmatter fence. The guard's
// property becomes: *no bracketed reading of these bytes asserts acceptance* —
// no reliance on modelling the external program correctly (issue #153, option 3).
//
// The plausible readings vary along TWO independent axes; the set below brackets
// both, so any decoder between the extremes is dominated by one of the readings
// (a union of readings can only ADD refusals — see contentAcceptRefusal — so a
// bracketing reading is pure fail-closed insurance).
//
// AXIS 1 — the escaped-backslash treatment. Two binary choices — (a) is `\\` an
// escaped escape? (b) is an unrecognized `\X` kept literal or is its backslash
// dropped? — generate exactly three COHERENT readings (the fourth combination,
// "drop `\X` yet NOT treat `\\` as an escape", is incoherent: dropping the
// backslash on an arbitrary `\X` IS treating `\\`→`\` for X=`\`):
//
//   R1 — no escaped escape. Recognize only `\n`/`\r\n`/`\t`, greedily, anywhere;
//        every other byte (a lone `\`, a `\\` pair) is literal. This is exactly
//        what the shipped regex did, so R1 preserves every refusal main already
//        made — it is kept verbatim, not re-derived. Note its artifact: in `\\n`
//        the regex finds `\n` at the SECOND backslash, so R1 emits `\`+newline.
//   R2 — escaped escape, unknown escape kept literal. `\\`→`\`, `\n`/`\r\n`→LF,
//        `\t`→tab; any other `\X` stays the two bytes `\X` (JSON/shell-ish).
//   R3 — escaped escape, unknown escape DROPPED. As R2 but `\X`→`X` (drop the
//        backslash) — the reading under which `\-\-\-` collapses to a bare `---`
//        fence and `accept\ed` to `accepted`, the escaped-escape family's sharp
//        edge.
//
// AXIS 2 — the RECOGNIZED-ESCAPE VOCABULARY. R1/R2/R3 all freeze it at
// `{\n, \r\n, \t}`, which is itself a bet on the binary: a richer decoder that
// honors NUMERIC escapes (`\xHH`, `\uHHHH`, `\u{…}`, octal `\NNN`) or the rest of
// the C letter set (`\a\b\f\v\e\0`) can encode the WHOLE fence — e.g. `\x2d`→`-`,
// `\x0a`→a real LF — invisibly to all three, reopening #153 one notch over
// (found by the independent review of this fix). So we add:
//
//   R4 — a MAXIMAL decoder: R3 (escaped escape, unknown letter escape dropped)
//        PLUS the numeric escapes `\xHH`/`\uHHHH`/`\u{…}`/octal decoded to their
//        code points. It is deliberately R3+numeric, not a full C decoder: a CLI
//        that decodes `\x` but drops `\e`→`e` (rather than ESC) is coherent, so
//        folding the ambiguous C letters `\a\b\e\f\v` to control codes would open
//        a gap between R3 and R4; dropping them (as R3) closes it. This is the far
//        corner of axis 2 and pure fail-closed insurance; it makes the
//        numeric-escape family a refusal too.
//
// The recognized set is thus bracketed by {minimal: R1/R2/R3} and {maximal: R4}
// rather than assumed — a strict improvement that covers the common escape
// dialects. But this NARROWS #153, it does not CLOSE it: the shipped binary's
// actual escape vocabulary was never observed, and review showed the enumeration
// keeps sprouting sub-axes (a greedy `\x` that eats all trailing hex, surrogate
// pairs, …) a finite reading set can still miss. A residual therefore remains —
// tracked in #153 — and its durable fix is architectural/empirical (this
// reconstruction is the SOLE guard on the CLI content path: the official CLI's
// `create` bypasses the plugin's app-side honored-byte guard), not one more
// reading. (Option 4 — pinning the binary's real vocabulary empirically — would
// let this set be trimmed to a proven-tight one; option 1 — modelling every
// escape — reopens the class on the next binary change.)
//
// Unlike the template path, the raw caller bytes are NOT a plausible reading:
// they are provably not what lands (the CLI un-escapes), so scanning them raw
// would model a program the CLI is not.

// fence pre-exec. That is a floor, not a proof: the vault expands Templater's
// `<% %>` tags AFTER the guard has looked, and Templater's own facilities
// (notably a date-format string that honors a literal-escape construct) can
// emit ARBITRARY characters — including an `acceptance-status: accepted`
// assertion AND the `---` fence delimiters around it — from a template whose
// bytes contain neither. So a template that scans clean can still land a note
// asserting acceptance. This is the #126 defect shape one level up: the bytes
// inspected are not the bytes that land.
//
// Nelson's ruling (Option 2): fail CLOSED on expansion tokens. A template
// whose resolved content carries ANY Templater expansion token cannot be
// inspected before it lands, so refuse the create rather than scan a document
// that is not the one the vault will honor. The escape hatch — expand it in
// Obsidian first, or use a template without expansion tokens — is named in the
// refusal so a legitimate caller is not merely stonewalled.
//
// Token set: the guard is deliberately conservative and refuses on TWO opener
// families, each matched as a SUBSTRING (not a parse — being broader than either
// grammar is the point, fail closed):
//   • ANY `<%` opener — the union of every Templater tag form (`<% %>`
//     interpolation, `<%* %>` execution, `<%~ %>` / `<%+ %>`, and the
//     `<%_`/`-%>`/`_%>` whitespace-control variants).
//   • ANY `{{` opener — the core Templates plugin's fields (`{{title}}`,
//     `{{date}}`, `{{time}}`, and the format forms `{{date:FMT}}`/`{{time:FMT}}`).
// The `{{ }}` family is NOT exempt, and the earlier claim that it "expands a
// fixed, closed set of values with no arbitrary-emission facility" was FALSE and
// is the exact hole this correction closes: `{{date:FMT}}`/`{{time:FMT}}` run FMT

// from a template file directly. Neither's payload appears in the call's

// `accepted` fence in an innocent note and launder it into a new note through
// the template path. Both templates ARE inspectable, though — they are vault
// files — so the closure is to resolve + read the template pre-exec (via the
// injected `readTemplate`; obsidian-free here, wired from server.ts) and run
// the SAME templateContentAcceptRefusal rule over it — which refuses both a
// static accepted fence AND any Templater expansion token (#137: the expanded
// output is not the scanned bytes, so an inspectable-only floor is not enough).
//
// Fail-closed discipline, matching the guard's own precedents: an
// unresolvable/unreadable template refuses (an uninspectable write must not
// fail open — the `if_rev`-without-kernel rule), and a missing `readTemplate`
// dep refuses any template-carrying call outright (the no-parser rule).
// Resolution here may be STRICTER than the CLI's own (we try the templates
// folder and the literal path; the CLI may accept fuzzier names) — a
// legitimate call refused by strictness gets a clear message naming the
// template; it can be retried with the exact name. Conservative by design.
