// accept-scan.ts — `scanForAcceptFence`: does a document about to be written
// assert acceptance anywhere in it?
//
// PUBLISHED AT S8 (the mutating tier's extraction), moved VERBATIM out of the
// host's `src/mcp/tools-cli.ts`. It had two callers there — the `obsidian_cli`
// template/content guard and the jd-scaffold module's `applyTemplate` — and
// after S8 those two callers live in DIFFERENT PLUGINS (the host's CLI proxy
// and the `vault-jd-scaffold` satellite). That is exactly the shape the
// vocabulary kernel had at S7, and it has the same forbidden answer: two copies
// of an accept predicate is how one vault gets two definitions of "accepted".
// The host imports it from here and re-exports it, so no host call site or test
// moved.
//
// The move is behaviour-preserving BY CONSTRUCTION rather than by inspection:
// every symbol this predicate is defined over — `leadingFrontmatterBlock`,
// `stripLeadingBom`, `acceptForbiddenReason`, `declaredProtectedProperties`,
// `canonicalPropertyKey` — was ALREADY core's. The host reached them through
// `mcp/write-notes-compose.ts`, which is itself a bare re-export of core's
// accept-guard. So this file computes over the same functions the host's copy
// did, not over a parallel definition.

/**
 * Two checks, deliberately different in kind:
 *
 *  1. **The leading fence** — decided by `leadingFrontmatterBlock`, the SAME
 *     recognizer the write path uses, applied to the SAME BYTES the vault will
 *     honor. Parity is structural here, not a matter of two normalizations
 *     happening to agree: #126 was a BOM asymmetry, and scanning a
 *     CRLF-folded copy re-opened the identical class on `\r` (a lone CR inside
 *     a scalar is content to the write path, a line break to a folded scan).
 *     Deciding over the raw document removes the whole class rather than its
 *     latest instance.
 *  2. **Embedded fences** — a deliberately BROADER, conservative sweep over a
 *     line-ending-folded copy. `append` content is not a note's leading
 *     frontmatter, and the resulting note cannot be read pre-exec, so an
 *     acceptance-asserting block anywhere in written content is refused.
 *     Broader than the write path is fine; narrower is the bypass.
