// HISTORY SCOPE — the stable, human-chosen include/exclude policy (WP4, D10).
//
// The single most important sentence in D10: "Connection scopes govern what
// one client may access; they never change what history already records." So
// this policy is a SEPARATE object from any allowlist, chosen by the human in
// settings after disclosure that Git retains historical bytes, and no
// connection can widen or narrow it. Changing it is a human settings and
// retention decision.
//
// Two modes:
//   - whole-vault: everything ordinary, minus the exclusions;
//   - explicit:    only the included roots, minus the exclusions.
//
// Exclusions always win. The defaults exclude what D10 names — volatile
// caches, local machinery, and explicitly private roots (the guarded
// territories arrive by injection from governance/territories, keeping this
// module pure and the territory list in its one home).

 * always excluded" — rather than an aspiration: a consumer reading
 * settings.historyScope raw would track .obsidian and record guarded
 * content, so the raw settings shape never reaches isTracked directly.
 *
 * Root normalization also closes an under-exclusion: an exclude entered as
