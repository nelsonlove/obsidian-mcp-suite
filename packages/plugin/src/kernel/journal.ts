// Write journal — kernel v0's audit stream.
//
// One JSONL record per mutating operation, appended to
// `<plugin data dir>/journal/YYYY-MM.jsonl` (rolled monthly). The record is
// OPERATION-centric, not filesystem-centric: git already says which bytes
// changed, this says what happened — which operation, against which target, on
// whose behalf, with what outcome.
//
// Append-only by construction: `append` is the only method that touches the
// file, and no edit/delete/compact API exists anywhere in this module. Rolling
// is by filename, so pruning is a manual, out-of-band act on whole months.
//
// Note bodies never enter the journal. Arguments are reduced to `argsDigest`
// (see digestArgs) so the journal stays a log of operations rather than a
// shadow copy of the vault.

 * queue abandoned on timeout (journaled `error`) settled afterwards, and the
 * corrective record — linked by `corrects` — says how. Append-only means the
 * original record is never rewritten; the correction is a new line.
 *
 * `conflict` is an `if_rev` precondition failure: the target's revision at
 * dequeue was not the one the caller expected, so NO write ran (`revBefore`
 * holds the revision actually found).
 *
 * `deduped` is an idempotency-key replay: a call whose key was already seen
 * returned the original call's result without executing anything, and
 * `dedupeOf` names the `ts` of the record it replays.
