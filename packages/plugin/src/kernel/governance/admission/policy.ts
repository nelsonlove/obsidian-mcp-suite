// ADMISSION POLICY — what admission REQUIRES, as one refusal table (WP6, §9).
//
// The guide's list of what the admission call does not accept, made
// structural. Every rule is a typed refusal with the reason in the message,
// because each refusal reaches a human deciding whether to fix or abandon.
//
// The policy is PURE: it receives facts (the proposal, the verification
// records, the authority reference, the clock) and answers. Gathering the
// facts honestly is the service's job; deciding is this module's.

 * caller controls both the subject and the records, it could forge matching
 * pairs freely (proven by the review's exploit: an unverified subject
 * admitted with hand-built passed:true records). Removing the field is the
 * fix §9 actually asks for: "resolves every required predicate" is the
 * service's act, and a verdict has no path into admission except through it.
 *
 * Order matters only for message quality — every rule is independently
 * sufficient to refuse, and none may be skipped for any caller.
