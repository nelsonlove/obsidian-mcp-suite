// Kernel v0 — the capabilities that ship in the transport: a serialized write
// queue (the transaction pipeline's embryo), a write journal (the audit
// stream), `if_rev` optimistic concurrency (precondition checking), idempotency
// keys (safe retries), and advisory locks (the claims mechanism). One instance
// per plugin, shared by every connection's server.
//
// Kernel.runMutation is the single place they all meet: it reserves or replays
// an idempotency key without executing anything, derives the operation's
// target, checks the caller's revision precondition at dequeue, runs the
// handler through the queue, and journals exactly one record per mutating
// operation whatever the outcome.
//
// ── idempotency: reserve at entry, share one outcome ─────────────────────────
//
// A key is claimed SYNCHRONOUSLY on the way in (IdempotencyStore.claim), before
// any await, so simultaneous retries of one dropped request cannot all become
// owners. Exactly one caller runs the operation; the rest await that owner's
// settlement and return the SAME envelope it produced (journaled `deduped`,
// with `dedupeOf` naming the owner's record).
//
// Waiters share the owner's outcome WHATEVER IT IS — one logical request, one
// outcome. If the owner throws (rev_conflict, write_timeout, probe failure),
// every waiter already attached rethrows that same error rather than racing to
// re-run the operation behind it. The free-key-on-thrown-failure rule applies
// only AFTER settlement: a thrown failure stores nothing and releases the key,
// so the NEXT call re-executes, while a returned envelope (ok or isError) is
// stored and replayed.
