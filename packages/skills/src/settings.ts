// settings.ts — the satellite's own settings shape, its field definitions, and
// the ONE-SHOT adoption of the host's `modules.skills.config`.
//
// ── Why adoption exists ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Before this extraction the skills compiler was a capability MODULE inside the
// Governor host, and its configuration lived in the host's data.json at
// `modules.skills.config` — output dir, plugin name, detection mode, field
// namespacing, assets root, release dir, export-on-save, preload cap. A user who
// upgrades gets a brand-new plugin with a brand-new, EMPTY data.json, and would
// silently start exporting to the default `~/.claude/skills/vault-skills`
// instead of wherever they actually publish. That is a data-shaped surprise, so
// the satellite adopts the host's values once, on first load.
//
// Three rules, all deliberate:
//
//   1. IT NEVER WRITES THE HOST'S SETTINGS. Not to delete the adopted keys, not
//      to mark them migrated, not at all. The host's settings shape is the
//      host's; a satellite reaching into another plugin's data.json to tidy up
//      is exactly the boundary this split exists to draw. The host's copy stays
//      where it is and simply stops being read (the module is gone from the
//      host, so nothing reads it there either).
//   2. IT RUNS ONCE. `adoptedFromHost` latches, so a later host edit does not
//      reach back in and overwrite what the user has since set here.
//   3. THE SATELLITE'S OWN VALUES WIN. If this plugin already has config keys
//      (host installed after the satellite, say), adoption fills only the gaps.
//
// If the host is ABSENT at first load, nothing is adopted and the latch is NOT
// set — the satellite works standalone, and if the host shows up later the
// adoption still gets its one chance.
