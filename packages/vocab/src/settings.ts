// settings.ts — the satellite's own settings shape, the PURE half of the
// per-instance settings form, and the ONE-SHOT adoption of the host's
// `vocabularies` setting.
//
// ── WHY ADOPTION LOOKS DIFFERENT HERE ───────────────────────────────────────
//
// The skills, triage and crosssession satellites all adopted from
// `modules.<id>.config` — a flat record of scalars the host's generic,
// manifest-driven config tab rendered. VOCAB HAS NO `modules.vocab.config`.
// The host's `VOCAB_MANIFEST` (mcp/modules-mount.ts) carries no `config:` block
// at all, and its comment says why: the vocab settings are a LIST of structured
// instances, which the scalar manifest-field renderer cannot express.
//
// The real setting is `settings.vocabularies`, a TOP-LEVEL host setting of type
// `VocabInstanceSettings[]` — declared in the host's `main.ts`, defaulted to
// `DEFAULT_VOCABULARIES.map(v => ({...v}))`, and edited by a BESPOKE
// per-instance form in the host's `connection-ui.ts` (`renderVocabInstances`).
// So `adoptHostConfig` below reads `hostSettings.vocabularies`, an ARRAY, and
// the three adoption rules are re-stated for an array-valued setting:
//
//   1. IT NEVER WRITES THE HOST'S SETTINGS. Not to delete the adopted rows, not
//      to mark them migrated, not at all.
//   2. IT RUNS ONCE. `adoptedFromHost` latches, so a later host edit does not
//      reach back in and overwrite what the user has since set here.
//   3. THE SATELLITE'S OWN VALUES WIN. "Fills only the gaps" means something
//      specific for a list: adoption happens only when this plugin has NO rows
//      of its own. Merging row-by-row would need an identity to merge ON, and
//      the only candidate (`id`) is exactly what a user renames — a merge would
//      silently resurrect a row they deleted here. All-or-nothing is the honest
//      version of rule 3 for a list.
//
// If the host is ABSENT at first load, nothing is adopted and the latch is NOT
// set — the satellite keeps the shipped defaults, and if the host shows up
// later the adoption still gets its one chance. The same is true when the host
// is present but its `settings` is still UNDEFINED: the host declares that
// field without an initializer and assigns it mid-onload, so an instance
// visible in the plugins map before that assignment is HOST NOT READY, not
// "host with empty settings". Treating it as the latter burns the one-shot
// latch on nothing and the user's config never adopts — found by the review of
// the skills extraction, and the reason the check in main.ts is `!== undefined`
// rather than a truthiness test.
//
// Incoming rows are coerced and screened with the SAME skip-and-report
// discipline the registry itself uses: a row that is not a plausible
// `{id, provider, root, config?}` object is DROPPED rather than imported. An
// unknown provider NAME is kept, not dropped — the registry reports it as a
// problem and the settings tab flags it, and dropping it would hide a
// misconfiguration the user needs to see. What gets dropped is structural
// garbage (a non-object, a row with no usable id), not a user's mistake.
//
// ── THE HOST'S COPY: STOPS BEING READ, BUT IS DELIBERATELY KEPT ─────────────
//
// The ordinary skills / triage / crosssession story holds here after all: the
// host's `settings.vocabularies` stops being read once the module leaves.
// Nothing in the host reads it — `getVocabularies` is gone from the server
// context, and the host's own bespoke settings form for it was REMOVED at this
// extraction (it became unreachable the moment the vocab module left
// `builtinModules`). There is no second live reader and no drift between two
// live copies.
//
// (An earlier draft of this file claimed there was, on the grounds that the
// host's conformance rail reads the setting. That was wrong, and the correction
// is worth recording so nobody re-derives the error: `runConformance` does take
// an `opts.vocabularies`, but all three of its call sites —
// `mcp/obsidian-drift-source.ts`, `mcp/obsidian-debt-source.ts` and
// `conformance/cli.ts`'s CLI entry point — pass `DEFAULT_VOCABULARIES`
// unconditionally. The rail has never read the user's configured list.)
//
// The field is nonetheless STILL DECLARED and STILL DEFAULTED in the host's
// main.ts, on purpose: it is the ADOPTION SOURCE. This plugin copies it once on
// its first load and never writes back, so deleting it there would destroy a
// user's configuration before the plugin that inherits it had a chance to read
// it. Removing it is a separate, dated decision for after the adoption window
// closes — see the `vocabularies` doc comment in the host's main.ts, which is
// the canonical statement of this.
//
// There is NO live operator state to migrate here — unlike crosssession's
// receipt file, this surface writes nothing outside its own data.json and reads
// nothing outside the vault. A checked fact, not an omission: the module's
// entire state was the `vocabularies` array plus the per-call listing.
//
// ── ONE REAL DISAGREEMENT REMAINS, AND IT IS THE HOST'S, NOT THE SPLIT'S ────
//
// Worth keeping, because the investigation above surfaced it: the host's
// conformance rail still depends on the vocabulary KERNEL — that is exactly why
// the kernel went to `@vault-mcp/core` rather than into this package — but it
// depends on it with the SHIPPED DEFAULTS. So conformance findings and this
// plugin's tools can still disagree about what is registered, in a vault whose
// user configured a non-default vocabulary. That is a PRE-EXISTING host gap
// (true before this extraction, unchanged by it), which the split merely makes
// easy to see. It is not a consequence of the split and there is nothing to fix
// here; it is flagged as a host observation in CLAUDE.md.

// THIS IS A MOVE, NOT A FORK — and the question was asked properly rather than

// by construction. The obvious worry here was that these helpers are the same

// with the form that used them — they had become unreachable when the vocab
// module left `builtinModules` — so this package now holds the ONLY copy.

// What these helpers must still not drift from is the registry's own vocabulary
// of problems, which is why `validateVocabInstances` is written against core's
// published `isVocabProvider` / `VOCAB_PROVIDERS` rather than a hand-listed
// set: the form warns about exactly what the runtime will skip, by construction.
