/**
 * docs-drift.test.mjs — conformance check for the rename/decommission class (#121).
 *
 * Docs drift from renames and retirements kept being re-filed as one-off issues
 * (#114 was the latest). This test makes the class regress-proof: retired names,
 * dead anchors, stale branch citations, and superseded architecture claims are
 * forbidden strings in the user-facing docs. A rename or decommission adds ONE
 * rule entry here instead of a future cleanup issue.
 *
 * Scope: docs/**·*.md (excluding docs/superpowers/ — dated design specs are
 * historical records) plus the root README.md. Code identifiers are NOT in
 * scope (the #115 rename owns those); this test guards prose.
 *
 * Rule shape: { id, pattern, allowIf } — a line matching `pattern` fails unless
 * it also matches `allowIf` (the annotated-legacy-context escape hatch).

// Invariant-claim allowlist ratchet (#152)
//
// LOOP.md's standard: invariant words in docs ("never", "every", "always",
// "cannot", "no way", "guarantee", "impossible") may only be published when
// the implementation substantiates them. Nothing enforced that, and it
// failed silently: #140 qualified "every mutating operation lands in an
// append-only journal" in README.md, because packages/server's FS-failover
// path writes with no journal (open: #92); hours later #149 rewrote the
// README and reintroduced the unqualified claim, with no mention of FS mode.
// It was caught only because the reviewer happened to remember that exact
// sentence from that morning.
//
// This check does NOT decide whether a claim is true — that stays a human
// judgement. It flags any span combining an invariant word with a
// security-relevant term, and fails CI unless that EXACT span text is in the
// checked-in allowlist below. The allowlist is a record of "a human looked
// at this sentence and deliberately decided it may be published" — not a
// truth assertion, and not a substitute for #92-style follow-through. A
// claim that changes even by a qualifying clause is a *different* span and
// needs its own approval; matching is exact-text on purpose, not fuzzy —
// deleting or adding a qualifier must trip the check, not slide past it.
