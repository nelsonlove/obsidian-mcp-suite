// VAULT SKILLS — the skills compiler as its own Obsidian plugin.
//
// Compiles the vault's skill / agent / policy / command notes into a Claude
// Code plugin and materializes it to disk. Two surfaces over one compiler core:
//
//   1. the HUMAN surface — a Preview pane, six palette commands, a ribbon icon,
//      and an opt-in export-on-save trigger (wiring.ts);
//   2. the AGENT surface — six MCP tools published to the Governor host through
//      vault-mcp-api (tools.ts), on the wire as `vault_skills_validate` …
//      `vault_skills_mark`, the same names they have always had.
//
// SATELLITE OF THE SUITE (suite-split design §6: "Skills compiler | private
// operator | satellite — the biggest single extraction; least entangled").
// Extracted out of the host at S4, following the quickadd-choices-compile
// pilot. Consequences of the publishing contract, each deliberate:
//
//   * THE ALLOWLIST BOUNDARY MOVED TO THE HOST, and got stricter. An external
//     tool's `readOnlyHint: true` is a claim the host distrusts unless the raw
//     publisher id is in its `trustedReadOnlyPlugins` list, so all six of these
//     register as mutating; and a mutating external tool whose arguments carry
//     no recognized path key is BLOCKED OUTRIGHT while a path allowlist is
//     active. Five of the six carry no path argument, so under an allowlist
//     they are refused wholesale rather than filtered. `vault_skills_mark` does
//     carry `path`, so it is scoped normally. The in-tool visibility filter is
//     kept as defence in depth — see the long note in tools.ts.
//   * REFUSALS THROW; the host renders a thrown error as its error envelope.
//   * The host's queue, journal and kernel args still apply — external mutating
//     tools ride the guarded registration path like every built-in.
//
// STANDALONE OPERATION IS A REQUIREMENT, not a nicety. With no host installed
// the pane, the commands, the ribbon and export-on-save all still work; only
// the tools go unpublished. That is why the human wiring is registered FIRST
// and `publishTools` last: `publishTools` is internally defensive (it registers
// now or on the host's ready event, and never throws out of onload), which
// makes the ordering belt rather than fix — but the claim and the code should
// agree. Same reasoning as the pilot's.
