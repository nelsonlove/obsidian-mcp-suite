// The accept-forbidden guard — the "the accept verb is in no API" invariant.
//
// Extracted from packages/plugin/src/mcp/write-notes-compose.ts (issue #104):
// this predicate previously lived ONLY in the plugin, so ObsidianBackend was
// guarded but the shared filesystem write primitive (fs-backend/vault.ts,
// wrapping VaultImpl — the implementation BOTH FilesystemBackend and
// packages/server's fs-failover mode's module-level singleton functions call)
// passed content straight through. Moving the pure decision logic here lets
// every VaultBackend implementation call the SAME predicate. DRY — one
// predicate, every write path.
//
// Obsidian-free by construction: everything here operates on plain objects
// and an injected YAML-parse function, so it is a real unit-testable module
// with no `obsidian` import, usable from packages/core and packages/server.
//
// ── The invariant this file is the point of ─────────────────────────────────
//
// No write may INTRODUCE or CHANGE a note's acceptance to the accepted-family:
// a payload/result whose frontmatter sets `acceptance-status: accepted` (or an
// `accepted-*` variant) or carries any `accepted` / `accepted-by` /
// `accepted-on` field is REJECTED before any write lands. The transport must
// never persist acceptance — acceptance is a human gesture only, granted
// directly in Obsidian, never through an API.
//
// The one thing the guard must NOT break: a legitimate edit that carries an
// existing (human-granted) accepted value forward UNCHANGED. So the rule is a
// TRANSITION over (before, after) — preserve is allowed, introduce/change is
// not.

 * **The opener and the closer are not symmetric, and that asymmetry is the

 * probe notes and reading them back through its own parser:
 *
 *   - The OPENER must be exactly `---` (after `stripLeadingBom`, at byte 0),
 *     with only spaces/tabs before the line break. `----` does not open a
 *     block; neither does `--- yaml`.
 *   - The CLOSER is the first later line whose first three bytes are `---`.
 *     Whatever follows those three dashes on that line is **body**, not part
 *     of the fence: `----` closes and leaves `-`, `---x` closes and leaves
 *     `x`, `--- ` closes and leaves a line holding one space. An INDENTED
 *     ` ---` does not close — the dashes must start the line.
 *   - A LINE BREAK is `\r\n`, `\n`, **or a lone `\r`**. Obsidian's fence scan
 *     honors a classic-Mac line ending on either fence: `---\nzz: 9\r---\n`
 *     and an all-CR document both parse (probed). This is the one place where
 *     the fence scan and the YAML parser genuinely disagree — a lone `\r`
 *     *inside* a scalar stays content (`parseYaml` does not split on it), so
 *     the same byte is a line break to the fence and content to the value.
 *     That asymmetry is not ours to reconcile; it is the vault's, and both
 *     halves are pinned in the oracle. `parseGuardFrontmatter` still REFUSES
 *     a block carrying a lone `\r` it cannot classify (#104), so widening the
 *     fence here does not widen what the subset parser will silently accept.
 *
 * This pattern therefore ends immediately after the closing `---`, and callers
 * that split on `match[0].length` get the vault's own body boundary. That is
 * deliberate: the remainder of the closer line is content, and a pattern that
 * swallowed it would make every reader drop a line the vault shows.
 *
 * The closer used to require `[ \t]*` and then a line break, which recognized
 * LESS than the vault honors — the #126 class on the other fence. Content whose
 * frontmatter asserted acceptance behind such a closer drew no refusal from the
 * accept guard while Obsidian parsed and honored it. Do not re-narrow this
 * without re-probing the vault; the oracle table in
 * `packages/plugin/tests/frontmatter-boundary-oracle.test.mjs` is the spec and

//
// The accepted family above is ONE hardcoded instance of a general rule: some

// an agent write that would move one. #224 generalizes the mechanism into a
// DECLARED list that threads in from plugin settings (human-only-mutable — no
// agent path writes plugin config) and is enforced HERE, inside the same two
// predicates every transport already reaches. No call site changes, no second
// definition, no per-transport reimplementation — a transport that enforces the
// accepted family enforces the declared list by construction.
//
// THE FLOOR IS NOT CONFIG. The accepted-family checks above run unconditionally,
// before and independently of the declared list: nothing a config can say —
// including an empty list — touches them. `normalizeProtectedProperties`
// additionally DROPS (loudly) any config entry naming an accepted-family key or
// `acceptance-status`: the family is already at maximum protection and must not
// look configurable, and `acceptance-status`'s non-accepted values are
// deliberately agent-writable workflow state (#228) that one bad config line
// must not be able to freeze. Config can only EXTEND the perimeter to NEW keys.
//
// Two grades per declared property:
//   • `agent-forbidden`     — introduce/change/remove refused through every
//     guarded transport; byte-identical carry-forward allowed. (Removal IS
//     refused for declared keys — stripping a human's declaration through an
//     agent transport is as much a mutation as changing it. The accepted family
//     keeps its historical exact semantics untouched.)
//   • `authority-conferring` — agent-forbidden PLUS honor-only-if-blessed: the
//     value only takes EFFECT once the write that set it is human-attributed or
//     accepted in review. The honor rule itself lives with the governance
//     module (`honoredValueFromBlessed` reads the accepted BASELINE, never raw
//     frontmatter); this guard supplies the write-side half and the grade.

// ── A minimal frontmatter parser for callers with no full YAML library ──────
//
// packages/core has no YAML dependency (its own frontmatter editing in
// fs-backend/vault.ts and fs-backend/index-store.ts is line-based and
// best-effort by design). `parseGuardFrontmatter` is a SEPARATE, small
// reader — scoped ONLY to feed this guard — that additionally recognizes an
// inline flow-MAP value (`key: {value: accepted}`), which
// fs-backend/index-store.ts's `parseAllFrontmatter` does not (it has no map
// type in its FrontmatterValue model). Without it, a hand-crafted map-wrapped
// accepted value could slip past the guard on the filesystem backend even
// though `isAcceptedValue` above already knows how to recognize one once
// parsed — this parser exists so that recognition is actually reachable on
// the fs write path (parity with S3 in the original plugin-only guard).
//
// It binds to the SAME `LEADING_FRONTMATTER_RE` / `stripLeadingBom` as
// `frontmatterOf` above — one fence recognizer, not two that can drift.
//
// ── Parse what the vault honors; fail closed only where parsing is impossible
// (residual on #104) ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The real honorer of this text is Obsidian's own YAML parser, which models
// the FULL language. This reader models a large, deterministic subset of it,
// and — crucially — treats "I could not classify this line" as a REFUSAL
// rather than as ABSENCE.
//
// The bug this closes: the previous reader silently SKIPPED any line it
// couldn't classify, so a construct real YAML honors could carry an
// acceptance assertion straight past the guard while `parseGuardFrontmatter`
// reported zero keys or a garbage value. A guard that recognizes LESS than
// the honorer is a bypass, not caution — the same shape as #126/#137, one
// layer down (the VALUE parser instead of the fence recognizer).
//
// The remedy for "cannot see it" is to SEE it, not to refuse everything
// containing it. Measured over every note WITH frontmatter in both real
// vaults, the refuse-on-nesting reader rejected 336/1468 (22.9%) of
// ~/obsidian and 1741/12072 (14.4%) of ~/obsidian-old — routine shapes, not
// exotic ones. So this reader PARSES, recursively and indentation-aware:
//
//   • nested block mappings (`plugin:\n  name: x\n  id: y`) to arbitrary depth
//   • block sequences, both indented and at the parent key's own column
//   • sequences OF mappings (`- title: Foo\n  date: 2024-01-01`)
//   • flow collections nested inside one another (`[[Wikilink]]`, `[{a: 1}]`)
//   • block scalars (`|`, `>`, with chomping/indent indicators)
//   • multi-line plain and quoted scalars (continuation lines)
//   • quoted scalars containing commas and colons
//
// and the acceptance predicate runs over the WHOLE resulting tree — so an
// `accepted`-family key or value nested inside a block mapping or a
// list-of-maps is now CAUGHT, which it never was before (it was silently
// dropped along with its parent).
//
// Fail-closed remains for the constructs where a confident classification is
// genuinely impossible without a full YAML document model:
//
//   • a raw control character in a line (the lone-`\r`-inside-a-scalar case
//     that is #104's original finding — `/\r?\n/` doesn't consume it, so the
//     byte sequence has already diverged from what the vault will honor)
//   • a tab used as indentation (YAML forbids it; what the honorer does with
//     the block is not something this reader should guess)
//   • YAML anchors/aliases (`&`/`*`) and explicit tags (`!`/`!!`) — an alias
//     resolves against an anchor defined elsewhere in the document, which
//     needs the document model this reader deliberately does not build
//   • an unterminated quoted scalar with no continuation
//   • a multi-document marker (`...`)
//   • an unparseable key line, or an unexpected indentation change
//
// Every one of those was verified absent from BOTH real vaults: at the time of
// PR #143 the refusal rate was 0/1468 and 0/12072 (0.0%). The reader is also
// differential-tested against PyYAML over the same 13,540 notes and agrees on
// the full key structure, nesting included, for every note either can parse
// (one note is invalid YAML that PyYAML itself rejects). Both bugs fixed here
// — the unquoted mapping key and the refused document-root flow collection —
// were found by that oracle, not by hand-written cases. See PR #143 / #104.
//
// Those counts were measured under the OLD, narrower fence recognizer, so
// widening the closer could in principle change which blocks the strict reader
// is handed. Re-measured on the live vault after the widening: 1517 notes,
// 1510 with frontmatter, 0 refusals, and 0 notes where the old and new
// recognizers disagree about the block. That corpus is far smaller than the
// original 13,540, so read it as "no regression observed here", not as a
// re-validation of the original figure.
//
// The widening does create a new refusal class — empirically absent from that
// corpus, but real and verified by hand: a note whose body opens with a long
// thematic rule directly under a fence (`---\nChapter one\n---------------\n`)
// now has the rule recognized as its closer, and the resulting block refuses
// as unclassifiable instead of being ignored. That is the safe direction —
// refusing beats writing past a block the vault will honor — and it matches
// what Obsidian does with the same bytes. But it is a behavior change on notes
// that previously appeared to work.
