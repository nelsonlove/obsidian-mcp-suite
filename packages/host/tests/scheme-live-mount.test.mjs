/**
 * Scheme panes live-mount WIRING pins (governor#286 / PR #289).
 *
 * The decision core (`mountAction`) is already pinned by governance-live-mount.test.mjs and is
 * REUSED here, so this file pins the part that is easy to regress silently: the wiring in main.ts.
 * Source scans, the repo's established shape for "this call site must keep existing" invariants
 * (cf. the link-healing glob scan and the registration-surface seals) — the live Obsidian mount
 * itself is un-headless.
 *
 * Three properties, each of which was a real defect class before #289:
 *   1. the module toggle DISPATCHES to the scheme panes at all (the #286 bug: the enabled flag was
 *      read once at onload, so toggling did nothing until a plugin reload);
 *   2. the scheme panes have their OWN reconcile chain — sharing governance's would let a rapid
 *      toggle of one pane interleave with the other's mount/unmount;
 *   3. both mount paths go through `mountAction`, so enable-while-mounted and disable-while-
 *      unmounted stay idempotent no-ops rather than double-wiring or double-tearing-down.
