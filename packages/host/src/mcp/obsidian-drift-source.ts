// obsidian-drift-source.ts — the Obsidian adapter for the scheme Drift pane
// (Stage C of the jd-dashboard fold, the "live conformance-engine call path"
// the design doc flagged as an open question). NOT a new call path: this
// reuses the exact same in-process `runConformance` call the ALREADY-SHIPPED
// `obsidian_conformance_debt` MCP tool makes (see obsidian-debt-source.ts,
// this file's sibling and closest precedent) — same root resolution, same
// baseline path (the plugin setting, then the env, #493) and excluded-roots env resolution, same DEFAULT_VOCABULARIES/
// DEFAULT_SCHEMES/legacyPacks:true config. The only difference is what
// happens to the result: obsidian-debt-source.ts discards the ratchet and
// keeps raw findings (debt reporting doesn't care about new-vs-carried);
// this keeps the ratchet and narrows to the scheme pack's NEW findings via
// conformance/drift-view.ts's newSchemeDrift, matching the original
// jd-dashboard drift panel's "show me what's newly wrong" framing.
//
// That difference is exactly why this file MUST run the pre-flight refusals
// `cli.ts`'s `runCli` runs before calling `runConformance` — `runConformance`
// itself has no such guard, it trusts whatever `baselineText`/`excludedRoots`
// it's handed (obsidian-debt-source.ts runs the same baseline refusal and the
// post-run coverage refusal, #294, but not the excluded-roots one, because it
// discards the ratchet — see below):
//
//   - `inAppBaselineRefusal` (the in-app form of the CLI's
//     `baselineMissingRefusal`): a MISSING or unconfigured baseline must never
//     silently read as empty. An empty baseline makes EVERY live finding read NEW — a
//     report that looks like catastrophic regression but is really a
//     missing/misconfigured file; here it would flood the pane with false
//     "new drift" for the vault's ENTIRE accepted-debt backlog on every
//     first-run/misconfigured/sync-glitch case. obsidian-debt-source.ts
//     runs the same refusal (#494), so both views give one message.
//   - `excludedRootRefusal`: the inverse hazard — an `excludedRoots` value
//     that would strand baseline keys under a root this run no longer looks
//     at makes those keys read CLEARED (falsely "resolved!"), for the same
//     reason. Also harmless in debt-source.ts (ratchet discarded), also not
//     harmless here.
//
// Verify this against a running Obsidian; the view core it feeds
// (drift-view.ts) is fully unit-tested.
