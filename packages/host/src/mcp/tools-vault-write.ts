This tool renames one heading in a note and rewrites every link to it across the notes you can see — wikilinks, embeds and markdown links, same-note [[#Heading]] links and heading chains ([[Note#A#B]]) — the headless equivalent of Obsidian's 'Rename this heading' command, which needs an editor cursor and a dialog. `heading` is the current heading text exactly as written (no leading #); links are matched the way Obsidian matches them, ignoring case and punctuation, so [[Note#Step 1 setup]] reaches '## Step 1: setup'. A heading that is not found is refused, and so is one that another heading in the note shares its links with, a new name that would share links with another heading, and a new name that contains [ ] | # ^ or %%.

Each link is rewritten at the position Obsidian's metadata cache records, after checking the text there still matches; a note that changed since is reported under `skipped`, never rewritten blind.
