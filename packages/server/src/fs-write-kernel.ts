/**
 * fs-write-kernel.ts — issue #92: the FS-fallback write path's serialized write
 * queue + append-only JSONL write journal.
 *
 * LIVE mode funnels every write through the plugin kernel's WriteQueue +
 * WriteJournal (packages/plugin/src/kernel/{write-queue,journal}.ts). FS
 * fallback mode had neither — a hole in the "every write is journaled" audit
 * claim (kernel-audit finding MEDIUM-6). This module is the lean, server-local
 * counterpart: packages/server depends on @vault-mcp/core + third-party only —
 * it does not, and must not, depend on packages/plugin — so the primitives are
 * re-stated here at the scale the FS write set needs (six backend methods)
 * rather than imported. The journal RECORD SHAPE deliberately matches the
 * plugin's JournalRecord field-for-field where the field is meaningful in FS
 * mode (ts, op, target, actor, argsDigest, outcome, error, durationMs,
 * queueWaitMs, revBefore, revAfter), so the two streams stay jointly greppable.
 *
 * Deliberate divergences from the plugin kernel (documented, not accidental):
 *
 * - **No write timeout / no corrective records.** The plugin's 30s timeout
 *   exists because Obsidian's app.* APIs expose no cancellation and a wedged
 *   call would wedge the bridge for every session. FS mode's writes are plain
 *   node:fs operations — they cannot wedge behind a UI thread, and a disk that
 *   hangs them hangs the whole process regardless. So the outcome domain here
 *   is just `ok | error` (no late-ok/late-error/conflict/deduped: FS mode has
 *   no if_rev and no idempotency keys to produce them).
 *
 * - **`actor.connection` is per-PROCESS, not per-connection.** FS mode builds a
 *   stateless McpServer per HTTP request; no per-session identity reaches the
 *   backend. The id still discriminates server restarts in a concatenated
 *   journal, which is what the field is for here.
 *
 * - **In-process serialization only.** The queue serializes every FS-mode write
 *   across all connections OF THIS PROCESS. Cross-PROCESS serialization (e.g.
 *   against an Obsidian instance racing the same files, or a second server
 *   process) is out of scope — nothing in a plain filesystem gives us a
 *   cross-process lock worth trusting, and the FS_ALLOW_WRITES gate (fs-mode.ts)
 *   exists precisely because that residual gap remains.
 *
 * Shared semantics kept from the plugin kernel, pinned by tests:
 * - one FIFO queue per process; reads never queue; enqueue order is run order;
 * - exactly one journal record per mutating operation, error outcomes included;
 * - `append` is the journal's only write path — no edit/delete/compact API;
 * - a journal that can't be written is logged and swallowed, never failing the
 *   vault operation;
 * - note bodies never enter the journal (digestArgs).
 *
 * Journal location: `<state dir>/journal/<vault-slug>/YYYY-MM.jsonl`, beside
 * the server's other state (`~/.claude/vault-mcp/` or $VAULT_MCP_STATE_DIR) —
 * NOT inside the vault tree, where it would sync as content and where the
 * plugin's own journal already lives. Override with $VAULT_MCP_FS_JOURNAL_DIR.
