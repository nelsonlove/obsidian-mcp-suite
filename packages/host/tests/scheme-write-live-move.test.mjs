/**
 * scheme-write-live-move.test.mjs — Task 5 of the scope-provider module:
 * real-Obsidian move verification + uid stability.
 *
 * The three mutating scheme tools (tools-scheme-write.ts, Task 4) all move a
 * note by calling `moveOne` (tools-vault-write.ts), which in turn calls
 * `app.fileManager.renameFile` — Obsidian's link-updating rename. That API
 * renames a path; it never opens, rewrites, or otherwise touches the file's
 * bytes. So a note's `uid` frontmatter — or any other content — must survive
 * a scheme mutation byte-for-byte. That is a property of the REAL handler
 * (moveOne, imported unmodified below), not of a re-implementation, so this
 * file follows link-healing.test.mjs's precedent: install the obsidian stub,
 * then `await import()` the real tool module so `renameFile` is exercised
 * for real rather than assumed.
 *
 * The stub-vault fixture here extends link-healing.test.mjs's fakeVault with
 * a `body` map (path -> raw markdown text, frontmatter included) that
 * `fileManager.renameFile` carries across the rename — exactly mirroring
 * what a real vault does (the bytes move with the file). Nothing in moveOne
 * or the scheme-write tools touches `body` directly; it exists only so this
 * test can read the note's content back through the same path table the
 * production code moved, and prove nothing happened to it.
