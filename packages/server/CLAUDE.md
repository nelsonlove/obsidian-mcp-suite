# CLAUDE.md — obsidian-vault-mcp-server

> Auto-loaded by Claude Code as project context. Describes the current (Phase 2a)
> monorepo server package — NOT the retired NixOS/VPS architecture.

## What this package is

The **presence-aware HTTP front** for the vault-mcp remote endpoint, hosted on
the macbook-pro behind a cloudflared tunnel (`obsidian.nelson.love`).

It is a single Express process (`src/front.ts`) that:

- Routes `/mcp` to the **LIVE proxy** (plugin-backed, 44 tools) when Obsidian's
  plugin Unix socket (`~/.claude/vault-mcp/<slug>.sock`) is reachable.
- Falls back to the **FS handler** (`@vault-mcp/core`'s `FilesystemBackend`,
  17 tools) when the socket is gone — no outage, graceful degradation.
- Returns to LIVE mode automatically when the plugin reconnects.

**FS-mode write caveat:** writes while Obsidian is closed are direct disk edits.
Obsidian Sync reconciles them on relaunch; they are canonical after that point.
Since issue #92 they are **serialized and journaled**: every FS-mode mutation
runs through a process-wide FIFO write queue and appends exactly one JSONL
record to the server-side journal (`src/fs-write-kernel.ts` — a lean,
server-local counterpart to the plugin kernel's WriteQueue/WriteJournal; this
package does not, and must not, depend on `packages/plugin`). Journal location:
`~/.claude/vault-mcp/journal/<vault-slug>/YYYY-MM.jsonl` (or under
`$VAULT_MCP_STATE_DIR`; override with `$VAULT_MCP_FS_JOURNAL_DIR`) — beside the
server's socket state, never inside the vault tree. Record shape matches the
plugin's `JournalRecord` field-for-field where meaningful (`ts`, `op`, `target`,
`actor`, `argsDigest`, `outcome: ok|error`, `error`, `durationMs`,
`queueWaitMs`, `revBefore`/`revAfter`), with `actor.server.mode:
"fs-fallback"` so the two streams stay jointly greppable; journal failures are
logged and swallowed, never failing the vault op; note bodies never land.

FS-mode writes remain **refused by default**, because queue+journal is not full
kernel parity: they still bypass the plugin kernel's governance surface
(`if_rev`, idempotency keys, advisory locks, pending review), and serialization
is in-process only — nothing serializes against a concurrently running Obsidian
or a second server process. A deployment opts in explicitly via
`VAULT_MCP_FS_ALLOW_WRITES=true` (`src/fs-mode.ts`'s
`isFsWritesEnabled`/`FsWritesDisabledError`), and `GET /health` reports the
current setting as `fsWritesEnabled`. Reads are never gated, never queued, and
never journaled.

## Auth (dual + per-user allowlist)

`src/auth.ts`'s `createAuthGate` accepts either:
- Static Bearer `VAULT_MCP_TOKEN` (Claude Code / API).
- Clerk OAuth opaque token (`oat_…`) validated via RFC 7662 introspection
  (`AUTH_INTROSPECTION_URL`) with client-binding (`AUTH_CLIENT_ID`/`SECRET`).

Startup is **fail-closed**: refuses to run without at least one auth method,
and with `AUTH_ENABLED=true` + no `AUTH_ALLOWED_SUBS`/`AUTH_ALLOWED_EMAILS`
(unless `AUTH_ALLOW_ANY_AUTHENTICATED=true`).

See `deploy/REMOTE.md` § 5 for the full env-var reference.

## Deployment

LaunchAgent runs `node dist/front.js`. Tunnel: cloudflared remotely-managed
(no local config.yml). Full setup: `deploy/REMOTE.md`.

## Build / test

```bash
npm run build --workspace packages/server   # tsc → dist/
npm test --workspace packages/server        # tsc + node --test dist/__tests__/*.test.js
```
