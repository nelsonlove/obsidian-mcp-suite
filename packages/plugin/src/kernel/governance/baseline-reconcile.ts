// Repointing baselines whose note MOVED — the identity half of the baseline store.
//
// A baseline is keyed by `contentHash(path)` (baseline-store.ts), and a path is a
// LOCATION, not an identity. So a rename or a move silently orphans the acceptance:
// the note reads as never-accepted, with no error and no signal anywhere. Measured
// on the real vault 2026-08-20: 158 of 273 baselines had drifted that way across a
// few weeks of reorganizations.
//
// The rename EVENT closes most of it (wiring re-keys on `vault.on("rename")`), but
// not all: a rename that happens while the plugin is not running — Obsidian closed,
// Sync landing a peer's move, another tool, a bulk script — is never observed. This
// module is the repair for exactly that residue, and it keys on the one thing that
// survives a move: the note's `uid`, which is carried inside the baseline's own
// stored content because the content is the note's full text, frontmatter included.
//
// DELIBERATELY NON-DESTRUCTIVE. The plan only ever REPOINTS. It never deletes a
// baseline — not for a note that vanished, not for a duplicate. A baseline is the
// machine-readable record of a human's acceptance; pruning that is a decision a
// human makes, not a repair a startup task performs. Everything it declines to
// repoint comes back as an `unresolved` entry with a reason, so a caller can report
// it rather than discover it later.

   * N-long chain settles in N runs. Only worth revisiting if real vaults produce long chains —
   * ordering the plan by dependency would trade a self-healing refusal for a live overwrite risk.
