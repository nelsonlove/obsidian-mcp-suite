// ADMISSION POLICY — what admission REQUIRES, as one refusal table (WP6, §9).
//
// The guide's list of what the admission call does not accept, made
// structural. Every rule is a typed refusal with the reason in the message,
// because each refusal reaches a human deciding whether to fix or abandon.
//
// The policy is PURE: it receives facts (the proposal, the verification
// records, the authority reference, the clock) and answers. Gathering the
// facts honestly is the service's job; deciding is this module's.
