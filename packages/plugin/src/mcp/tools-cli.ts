// obsidian_cli — proxy to the official Obsidian CLI, closing the breadth gap
// (file history/diff/restore, themes, snippets, plugin install/uninstall,
// publish, …) without hand-writing a native tool per command. The CLI binary
// is Obsidian's single-instance forwarder: it IPCs the command into this very
// Obsidian process, so it only works while Obsidian is running — which is
// guaranteed here, since this plugin *is* Obsidian.
//
// Safety model:
//   - annotations.readOnlyHint: false → read-only mode blocks the tool wholesale
//     (the guard can't know which CLI commands mutate; assume all do).
//   - CLI args can't be path-scoped, so the tool refuses to run while a path
//     allowlist is active — the same policy as unscopable external tools.
//   - Dangerous commands (eval, dev:*, devtools, restart, reload, command,
//     plugins:restrict) are refused unless the "Allow dangerous CLI commands"
//     plugin setting is on. `eval` and `dev:cdp` are full JS execution inside
//     Obsidian's Electron process — the gate defaults off.
//   - The vault is pinned to THIS vault (`vault=<name>` is always the first
//     arg); a caller-supplied vault param is rejected, so a session can never
//     cross into another vault through the proxy.
//   - Accept-forbidden guard (cliAcceptRefusal): the scar "the accept verb goes
//     in no API" is enforced at the MCP note-write primitive, and the CLI proxy
//     would otherwise bypass it. property:set and content writes (create/append/
//     prepend/periodic) are checked with the SAME accepted-family rule before
//     the command runs. quickadd / eval / command run arbitrary macros/code and
//     cannot be inspected — DENIED BY DEFAULT via the command policy
//     (cli-policy.ts), re-enabled only per-command through human-only settings.
//   - Command policy (cli-policy.ts): a settings deny list (always wins) plus
//     the deny-by-default opaque-accept set above; refusals are typed
//     Error [cli_denied] and run before the danger gate, which still applies.

// ── accept-forbidden guard on the CLI path ────────────────────────────────────
//
// The scar "the accept verb goes in no API" is enforced at the MCP note-write
// primitive (write-notes-compose.ts / obsidian-backend.ts). obsidian_cli proxies
// ~104 CLI commands straight past that primitive, so acceptance could be written
// through the CLI: `property:set name=acceptance-status value=accepted`, or a
// create/append/prepend whose content carries an `accepted` frontmatter fence.
// We reuse the SAME rule (`acceptForbiddenReason`, over the same deep
// accepted-family detector) here, BEFORE the command runs — no second definition
// of "accepted". A CLI property set / content write is always an INTRODUCE (the
// CLI path has no "carry an existing human-granted value forward" expression),
// so the introduce check is exactly right.
//
// RESIDUAL — CLOSED on both fronts, two mechanisms that compose:
//   • The opaque macro/code commands (`quickadd`/`quickadd:run`/
//     `quickadd:run-template`/`eval`/`command`) can set acceptance where no
//     guard can inspect — DENIED BY DEFAULT by the command policy
//     (cli-policy.ts), re-enabled only per-command through the human-only
//     `cliPolicy.allowOpaque` setting; a re-enabled `eval` still needs
//     allowDangerousCli.
//   • `create template=<t>` draws frontmatter from a template note the params
//     only NAME. The template guard below resolves and reads it and applies
//     the same rule pre-exec (unresolvable fails closed). It refuses a template
//     carrying a literal accepted fence (the STATIC case), AND — the post-scan
//     expansion hole this once left open (#137) — it now FAILS CLOSED on any
//     expansion token in the resolved bytes: a Templater `<%` opener OR a
//     core-Templates `{{` field opener.
//
//     Why the expansion check is needed: Obsidian expands both Templater `<% %>`
//     tags and core Templates `{{date:FMT}}`/`{{time:FMT}}` fields AFTER a byte
//     scan, and BOTH honor moment's `[…]` literal escape — so an expansion could
//     emit both the acceptance assertion and the fence characters from a
//     template that contains neither, and the scanned bytes would not be the
//     landed bytes (the #126 defect shape one level up). The `create template=`
//     path uses the core Templates plugin specifically, so `{{date:FMT}}` is a
//     live arbitrary-emission facility on exactly this surface — carving it out
//     was the flaw. Because the expanded output cannot be inspected pre-render, a
//     template carrying ANY expansion token is refused outright
//     (`templateExpansionRefusal`, below) rather than scanned and trusted. The
//     static scan remains for templates with no expansion token but a literal
//     fence.
//
//     A re-enabled `quickadd:run-template` gets the same checks on its `path=`
//     template. It remains in the policy's default-deny set regardless, because
//     QuickAdd's own runtime-computed frontmatter (distinct from the template
//     file's bytes) stays opaque.

// `<% %>` tags AFTER the guard has looked, and Templater's own facilities
// (notably a date-format string that honors a literal-escape construct) can
// emit ARBITRARY characters — including an `acceptance-status: accepted`
// assertion AND the `---` fence delimiters around it — from a template whose
// bytes contain neither. So a template that scans clean can still land a note
// asserting acceptance. This is the #126 defect shape one level up: the bytes
// inspected are not the bytes that land.
//
// Nelson's ruling (Option 2): fail CLOSED on expansion tokens. A template
// whose resolved content carries ANY Templater expansion token cannot be
// inspected before it lands, so refuse the create rather than scan a document
// that is not the one the vault will honor. The escape hatch — expand it in
// Obsidian first, or use a template without expansion tokens — is named in the
// refusal so a legitimate caller is not merely stonewalled.
//
// Token set: the guard is deliberately conservative and refuses on TWO opener
// families, each matched as a SUBSTRING (not a parse — being broader than either
// grammar is the point, fail closed):
//   • ANY `<%` opener — the union of every Templater tag form (`<% %>`
//     interpolation, `<%* %>` execution, `<%~ %>` / `<%+ %>`, and the
//     `<%_`/`-%>`/`_%>` whitespace-control variants).
//   • ANY `{{` opener — the core Templates plugin's fields (`{{title}}`,
//     `{{date}}`, `{{time}}`, and the format forms `{{date:FMT}}`/`{{time:FMT}}`).
// The `{{ }}` family is NOT exempt, and the earlier claim that it "expands a
// fixed, closed set of values with no arbitrary-emission facility" was FALSE and
// is the exact hole this correction closes: `{{date:FMT}}`/`{{time:FMT}}` run FMT
// through moment, which honors the `[…]` literal escape — so a single field can
// emit an `acceptance-status: accepted` assertion AND the `---` fence around it,
// through the plain `create template=` path, from a template whose bytes carry
// neither. That is the same arbitrary-emission facility as Templater's date
// format, so the whole `{{ … }}` class fails closed, not a carved-out subset.
// Per Nelson's Option-2 ruling this refuses dated/titled templates (the common
// case) — that cost IS the ruling; the carve-out was the deviation. The escape
// hatch (expand in Obsidian first, or use a template with no expansion token) is
// named in the refusal, so a legitimate caller is not merely stonewalled.
