// The scope-provider module's read-only surface: five tools over the
// ScopeRegistry (kernel/scheme/registry.ts) — list the configured schemes,
// resolve an address in either direction, compute (never reserve) the next
// free address in a scope, list a scope's members and open slots, and check
// where an address (or a note) is expected to live.
//
// Nothing here mutates anything. `obsidian_next_address` in particular only
// COMPUTES — the actual exclusivity story is `obsidian_claim_scope`
// (tools-locks.ts, kernel v0's advisory claims), which this tool's
// description points callers at explicitly: two sessions racing this tool
// can compute the identical answer, and only a claim (or the note actually
// landing) settles who gets it.
//
// Allowlist-aware like tools-uid.ts and tools-links.ts, and for the same
// reason: the registry resolves addresses against the WHOLE vault listing, so
// an unfiltered surface would be a path oracle for whatever a sandboxed
// session cannot see. `ctx.notes()` is filtered through `visiblePaths` once
// per call, BEFORE it ever reaches a provider method — membersOf, nextFree,
// expectedFolder and registry.resolve all see only the visible set, so a note
// occupying a slot outside the allowlist is invisible to "what's free" the
// same way it is to "what's here" (no existence oracle: 0 visible candidates
// reads as not-found even when a hidden note carries the address). A `path`
// argument gets the same one-path check tools-uid.ts's reverse lookup uses,
// since a test can call these handlers directly, bypassing the outer guard
// wrapper server.ts installs.
//
// Imports nothing from `obsidian`: like tools-uid.ts and tools-links.ts, this
// module is Obsidian-free and unit-testable headlessly. `findings.ts` (the
// conformance rule-pack) is deliberately NOT imported here — it is rail
// material for a later task, not a tool.
