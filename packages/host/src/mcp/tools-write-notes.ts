// obsidian_write_notes — batch write + opt-in server-side stamping (slice B1).
//
// The MIRROR of obsidian_move_notes, but with one deliberate difference that is
// the whole point of the slice: every item gets its OWN journal record, so
// Stewardship sees each note individually. A batch move is one operation over
// many paths (one record, `target.paths`); a batch write is N independent
// writes that happen to be submitted together.
//
// ── why it dispatches instead of writing inline ──────────────────────────────
//
// To give each item its own record, each item must run through the kernel's
// runMutation — the SAME serialized queue + journal + if_rev + idempotency that
// backs every single write. But the guard monkeypatch (server.ts) already wraps
// every MUTATING registration in ONE runMutation, and the write queue is
// non-reentrant (a queued closure that enqueues again deadlocks behind itself).
//
// So this tool follows the obsidian_call_tool precedent exactly: it registers
// UNGUARDED (via the pre-monkeypatch registrar) so it takes no outer queue slot,
// and drives a per-item GUARDED single-writer itself. The per-item handler is a
// real makeGuarded wrapper, so uid addressing, read-only mode, the allowlist,
// if_rev, idempotency and the journal all bind per item exactly as on the full
// surface — nothing is reimplemented. A read-only session's items each fail with
// `read_only`; an out-of-allowlist path fails with `out_of_allowlist`; the batch
// never aborts on one item's failure.
//
// Obsidian-free by construction: the two Obsidian-touching concerns — reading a
// note's existing frontmatter from the metadata cache and serializing YAML — are
// injected by server.ts, so the dispatch/compose/stamp/accept-forbidden surface
// is unit-testable headlessly against a real Kernel and fake vault.
