/** The Claude Code MCP server name — tool prefixes become `mcp__vault-mcp__*`.
 *
 * Renamed BACK from `governor` at the suite split's S3c (Nelson's ruling,
 * 2026-09-09). 0.12.0 moved it `vault-mcp` → `governor` with the plugin id;
 * the split moves both back, because after the split `governor` names the
 * governance PROVIDER and prefixing the HOST's tools with it is the same
 * architectural lie the `obsidian_pending_review` → `governance_pending_review`
 * rename fixed one level down. The stated, accepted cost is one-time: an
 * operator's `mcp__governor__*` permission entries must be re-added as
 * `mcp__vault-mcp__*`.
 *
 * Claude Code does NOT sanitize the server name into the tool prefix — a
 * hyphen survives (`mcp__vault-mcp__obsidian_read_note`), which is exactly the
 * spelling this server used before 0.12.0 and the spelling the operator's own
 * `~/.claude/settings.local.json` still carries from that era.
 *
 * The plugin never removes a stale `governor` registration itself — that is a
 * deliberate human step at cutover (`claude mcp remove governor`), and until it
 * is taken, `claudeLegacyIsRegistered` makes the half-migrated state visible in
 * the settings tab rather than letting it read as clean. */
