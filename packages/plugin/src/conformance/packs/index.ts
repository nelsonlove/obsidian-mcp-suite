// packs/index.ts — the built-in rule packs. The vocab + scheme module adapters
// came first; the ported legacy checks land here as native packs. All four
// legacy Python scripts are now ported (structure ← conformance_check, port ←
// port_lint, ste ← ste_lint, drift ← drift_audit) — the Python rail is retired.
// A plain list for now; when the config-host (worker-3) lands, the pack
// registry subscribes to it (each pack's SurfaceDocs entry) rather than
// inventing its own directory.
