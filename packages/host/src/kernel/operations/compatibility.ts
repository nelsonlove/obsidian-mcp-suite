// The COMPATIBILITY ADAPTER — Gate 0, WP0 (D18).
//
// Every surface that exists today predates the action registry. Rewriting all
// 123 of them before the registry exists would be a big-bang refactor of a
// working product; leaving them unregistered would make "every reachable
// invocation resolves to a registered action" false on day one. D18 settles
// this: establish the seam early, derive a CONSERVATIVE contract for what
// already exists, and migrate to native contracts in risk order.
//
// A compatibility action is derived from what the adapter can actually SEE at
// a registration site: the tool's name, its `readOnlyHint` annotation, its
// owning module, and which of its arguments carry paths. That is genuinely all
// it can see. It cannot see whether a read's payload is worth replaying,
// whether a handler's postcondition is verifiable, or what a diff's change
// class turns out to be — so it says none of those things.
//
// The rule that makes this safe rather than merely convenient: a derived
// contract may claim only what the existing implementation already proves.
// `registry.ts` enforces it (`compatibility_overclaim`), so a future edit that
// quietly upgrades a compat action to `replayable` fails the build instead of
// laundering a guess into evidence.
//
// The migration metric falls out for free: every compat action is
// `compat.<surface>`, so the count of `compat.` ids is exactly the remaining
// migration debt, and it is visible in one grep.
