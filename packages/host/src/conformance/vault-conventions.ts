// vault-conventions.ts — the vault-shaped paths the ported legacy packs depend
// on, in ONE place, injectable, and since #403 (ruled 2026-09-26) a HOST
// SETTING with EMPTY defaults: the plugin ships no vault layout.
//
// WHY THIS FILE EXISTS. The four legacy packs are faithful ports of Python
// scripts written for one specific vault, so they necessarily know that vault's
// folder layout: where the registries live, where the system spine is. That
// knowledge is legitimate — it is the packs' subject matter — but scattering it
// as string literals through the pack sources made it invisible and
// unchangeable: a different vault could not use these packs at all, and
// changing a path meant a release.
//
// So the keys are named and discoverable in one file. Where they point is the
// operator's: the three keys are a host setting (settings tab, Conformance),
// read live per call by the in-app debt and drift sources, and the standalone
// CLI takes them from `VAULT_MCP_CONVENTIONS` (a JSON object; the old spellings
// `GOVERNOR_VAULT_CONVENTIONS` and `ASSENT_VAULT_CONVENTIONS` are accepted as
// legacy aliases for one release and warned on). An EMPTY key reads as that
// convention DEAD: its packs register, are not measured, and the report says
// so (#298's mechanism). The former shipped values survive only as
// `LEGACY_CONVENTIONS_SEED`, written ONCE into an install whose data.json
// predates the setting, by exactly one reader (`conventions-policy.ts`).
//
// THREE keys since #412 (ruled 2026-09-27). The record had six; the other
// three (`artifactsRoot`, `pluginStackPath`, `uidExemptPaths`) named a vault
// shape the rebuilt vault no longer has, and their only readers were the
// drift checks #412 retired. A key nobody reads is a setting that lies, so
// they are gone from the record, not blank: `resolveConventions` drops them
// from a data.json that still carries them.
//
// This does NOT make the packs vault-agnostic — a pack that checks "registry
// entries are named consistently" is meaningful only where such a registry
// exists. It makes the coupling explicit and configurable rather than baked in,
// which is the difference between a documented assumption and a hidden one.

// ── dead paths are loud, never "checked and clean" (#298) ────────────────────
//
// A convention path that names nothing never errors: a registries root that
// does not exist means the registry checks find no registries and report
// clean; a system root that has moved means no category collision is ever
// seen. Both directions are silent, which is how six of seven shipped paths
// drifted dead without a test noticing. So every path-valued key is checked
// against the walk BEFORE the legacy packs run, and a dead one becomes a
// `conformance_engine / dead_convention` finding (NEW, so the run fails loudly)
// while the pack that depends on it is treated as NOT MEASURED — which is what
// `coverageRefusal` then refuses over, exactly as it refuses a pack that threw.
// Nothing here guesses a replacement path: where a convention should point is
// a vault filing question (#298's own blocking ambiguity), answered by the
// operator in the plugin's Conformance settings (or `VAULT_MCP_CONVENTIONS`
// for the CLI), never by a default. Since #403 a BLANK scalar key is dead too:
// the plugin ships every key blank, and "blank reads as dead, loudly" is what
// keeps that from reading as "checked and clean".
