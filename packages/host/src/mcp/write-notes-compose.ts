// Pure composition + stamping logic for obsidian_write_notes (slice B1).
//
// Obsidian-free by construction: everything here operates on plain objects and
// injected functions (`mintUid`, `formatTs`, `stringifyYaml`), so the whole
// stamp/accept-forbidden/canonical-order surface is unit-testable headlessly,
// exactly like the rest of the kernel-adjacent logic. The one Obsidian-touching
// concern — reading a note's existing frontmatter from the metadata cache and
// serializing YAML — is injected by tools-write-notes.ts.
//
// ── The invariants this file is the point of ─────────────────────────────────
//
//  1. `stamp` NEVER writes acceptance. It defaults `acceptance-status: proposed`
//     ONLY when the field is absent from BOTH the payload and the existing note,
//     and it NEVER mints or elevates to `accepted`. An existing acceptance-status
//     on disk is PRESERVED verbatim (including a human-granted `accepted`) —
//     changing it would destroy the human's decision, which the invariant equally
//     forbids ("never change an existing acceptance-status value"). The only way
//     `accepted` reaches disk through this tool is if it was already there; a
//     caller can never inject it (invariant 2).
//
//  2. Accept-forbidden guard (stamped or not): a payload whose frontmatter sets
//     `acceptance-status: accepted` (or an `accepted-*` variant) or carries any
//     `accepted` / `accepted-by` / `accepted-on` field is REJECTED before any
//     write. The transport must never persist acceptance — this defends the
//     "the accept verb goes in no API" scar at the write path.
//
//  3. `stamp` is opt-in per call — the caller passes it; nothing here turns it
//     on. A uid on a template merge-payload mass-corrupts instance uids, so a
//     write that must not be stamped simply omits the flag.

// ── the accept-forbidden guard, over RESULTING vs on-disk frontmatter ─────────
//
// The scar is "the accept verb is in no API": no MCP write may INTRODUCE or
// CHANGE a note's acceptance to the accepted-family. ONE definition, in
// packages/core/src/accept-guard.ts (issue #104) — packages/core has no
// dependency on packages/plugin, so core is the correct home for the single
// definition and this module imports it, never the other way around. This
// also carries PR #129's fix (#126): `stripLeadingBom` + the BOM-free
// `LEADING_FRONTMATTER_RE` are the ONE recognizer of a note's leading
// frontmatter fence, so a guard can never again be narrower than what the
// write path (and Obsidian) actually honors. Re-exported here unchanged so
// every existing import of this module (obsidian-backend.ts, tools-cli.ts,
// tests/accept-fence-parity.test.mjs) keeps working without a call-site
// change.
