/**
 * host-governor-boundary.test.mjs — THE STRUCTURAL BOUNDARY (suite split, S1).
 *
 * The suite-split design (docs/suite-split-design.md §2) names three roles: the host (an
 * audited MCP server over the vault), the governance provider (everything that decides
 * authority), and the satellites. S1 makes the first two boundaries STRUCTURAL rather than
 * conceptual: the governance provider's future sources now live in exactly one subtree,
 * `src/governor/`, split into `src/governor/kernel/` (the pure logic, formerly
 * `src/kernel/governance/`) and `src/governor/wiring/` (the Obsidian-facing layer — pane,
 * wiring, stores — formerly `src/governance/`). Nothing else moved and nothing runs
 * differently; one plugin artifact still builds from one `src/`.
 *
 * THE INVARIANT this file pins:
 *
 *   Exactly one subtree — `src/governor/` — contains the governance provider's sources, and
 *   the host never imports governor internals except through the explicitly enumerated seam
 *   list below.
 *
 * Why a test and not a convention: S2 replaces the hook-shaped crossings with the seam (§5) and
 * S3 makes the two subtrees two plugin artifacts. Both steps are only reviewable if the set of
 * crossings is a checked-in number that a diff moves. A new host→governor import that nobody
 * enumerated is exactly the drift that would make S3's split unplannable, so it fails here.
 *
 * The tables are DESCRIPTIVE of today, not aspirational. Every entry is a real edge in the
 * tree as it stands; adding one is a deliberate act with a line in a diff. Shrinking them is
 * the work of S2 and S3 — `EXPECTED_HOST_TO_GOVERNOR` should approach "main.ts registers the
 * provider through the seam, and nothing else", and `EXPECTED_GOVERNOR_TO_HOST` should
 * approach "the provider depends on published contracts only".
 *
 * ── WHAT S2 MOVED, AND WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DID NOT ─────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * S2 built the seam (`src/mcp/seam.ts`) and consumed it in-tree: 45 host→governor edges became
 * 32, and the ones that went are the ones the seam was for.
 *
 *   • `mcp/tools-core.ts` went from FIVE crossings to ZERO. That file declares `ServerCtx`, the
 *     host's per-connection context, and it named five provider types purely to carry provider
 *     PORTS across — the mandate store's verbs, the proposal store's verbs, the session record.
 *     A host context that describes the provider's data model cannot be a host contract at S3.
 *     Proposal production went behind `registerWriteObserver`; the mandate tools now arrive as
 *     registrars from the composition root (`BuildOpts.providerTools`); the session contract
 *     moved host-side, because the host mints sessions (condition 7).
 *   • `mcp/server.ts` went from NINE to FOUR. The `propose` block — class firewall, proposal
 *     builder, mandate stamping, history recording — is now `governor/wiring/write-observer.ts`
 *     behind the seam, and the session liveness consultation is the seam's refusal hook.
 *
 * What S2 did NOT do, so the remaining numbers are not mistaken for drift:
 *
 *   • `server.ts` still imports `canonical-json` and `digest`, for the SESSION SCOPE DIGEST —
 *     a host assertion about a connection. The seam itself does not need them; promoting them
 *     into `@vault-mcp/core` is S3's contract-publishing package.
 *   • `server.ts` still imports `territories` and the observation blob store: §5 left the
 *     observations ruling (host-side capture with territories as host config, or a capture
 *     hook) open, and it is S3's call.
 *   • `tools-governance-revision.ts` still crosses twice, one of which is the triage-dispositions
 *     inversion condition 9 names — also deferred to S3.
 *   • `tools-governance-mandate.ts` still physically sits in `src/mcp/`. Its registration no
 *     longer runs through `ServerCtx`, which is what mattered; the file itself moves with the
 *     rest of the provider's tools at S3.
 *
 * The other direction GREW, from 7 to 10, and that is the intended shape rather than a
 * regression: every new entry is the provider depending on something the HOST is ruled to own —
 * the session contract (condition 7), the native write action, and the seam's own types. This
 * list is the "publish as a contract or copy it" work item for S3, so entries arriving here
 * from the other table is the split proceeding, not decaying.
 *
 * Instrument discipline: the scan is a pure function over a { path -> source } map, and it is
 * exercised against a synthetic tree with a planted violation BEFORE it is trusted against the
 * real one. A source scan that silently matches nothing is worse than no scan.
