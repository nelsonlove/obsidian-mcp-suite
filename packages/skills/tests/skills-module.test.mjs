/**
 * skills-module.test.mjs — the vault-skills satellite's tool surface. Four
 * things this must prove, three of them carried over unchanged from the
 * folded-into-the-host era (#82) and one new to the extraction:
 *
 *   1. the six tools are BUILT with the names and read/write flags that make
 *      the host publish them as `vault_skills_validate` … `vault_skills_mark`
 *      — the shipped spelling, which renaming would break for agent sessions;
 *   2. the surface contributes NO accept/approve tool;
 *   3. vault_skills_mark CANNOT write an acceptance assertion — the mark path
 *      runs the shared accept-forbidden transition guard, so a mark that would
 *      introduce/change an accepted-family field is REFUSED and nothing is
 *      written, while preserving an existing (human-granted) accepted value is
 *      allowed. This was the load-bearing requirement of the fold and it is the
 *      load-bearing requirement of the extraction: `acceptTransitionReason`
 *      lives in @vault-mcp/core, a published contract, so leaving the host did
 *      not leave the guard behind;
 *   4. the one-shot settings adoption from the host's `modules.skills.config`
 *      copies, latches, never clobbers this plugin's own values, and NEVER
 *      writes the host's settings.
 *
 * The preview read-boundary tests are kept in full even though `ctx.getSettings`
 * is not supplied in production — the filter is defence in depth for a future
 * apiVersion that can carry scope to a publisher, and an untested dormant guard
 * is a guard that will not work when it wakes up. See tools.ts's long note.
 *
 * Headless: tools.ts imports nothing from `obsidian`; the vault arrives as a
 * fake SkillsBackend and the accept guard runs over plain objects.
