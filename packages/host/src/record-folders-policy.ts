// record-folders-policy.ts — the folder indicator's on-load decision (#482),
// pure and obsidian-free, the same shape as territory-policy.ts and
// conventions-policy.ts.
//
// The ruling (Nelson, 2026-10-02 and 2026-10-03): which folders hold records is
// the operator's setting, and "No folder names are ever in the live code". So
// the plugin ships an EMPTY folder indicator: no record folders and no archive
// pattern. The folders and the pattern this vault used while they were
// hard-coded (#455) survive only as `LEGACY_RECORD_FOLDERS_SEED`, written ONCE
// into an upgrading install's own settings by `recordFoldersOnLoad`, so that the
// upgrade does not silently stop protecting its records.
