// rule-pack.ts — the RulePack contract and the vault snapshot packs run over.
//
// A rule pack is a named producer of Findings over a supplied snapshot — the
// same "rail feeds a listing, pack returns typed findings" contract the module
// findings functions already honor (they are pure over an injected listing).
// The module adapters (packs/) wrap `noteVocabFindings` / `schemeFindings`;
// the ported legacy checks (phase 2) implement `run` directly. No pack reads
// the vault itself — the engine injects the snapshot.

// findings and the ratchet then reports every one of its accepted keys as
// CLEARED — a clean bill of health produced by a missing input (#125).
//
// `[]` is a real answer and keeps working. `undefined` is the ABSENCE of an
// answer and throws, which the engine surfaces as a `conformance_engine /
// pack_error` finding naming the pack — visible and non-zero, the same
// discipline the engine already applies to a pack that crashes.

// (#104's residual), and this. Absence and emptiness are never the same answer.
