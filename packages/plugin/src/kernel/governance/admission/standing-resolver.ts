// STANDING RESOLVER — the read side of authority (WP6, D08/D11).

// D11's consequence: current bytes and standing may differ, and
// standing-aware consumers need an explicit API rather than treating raw
// vault content as admitted. This is that API's kernel: given the claim
// store and the current standing ref value, answer what stands — read-only,
// no ref advancement anywhere near it (D08: external tools resolve standing
// without internal refs; internal ones go through here for the same reason).
