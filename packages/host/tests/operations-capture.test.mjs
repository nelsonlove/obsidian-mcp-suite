/**
 * operations-capture.test.mjs — WP2's vertical slice, Gate 0.
 *
 * The point where the observation substrate stops being contracts and starts
 * writing note text to disk. Everything here is about the conditions under
 * which that happens, because the failure that matters is not "capture broke"
 * — it is "capture happened when nobody asked for it".
 *
 * Three gates, and a read is captured only if ALL of them agree:
 *
 *   1. the human turned it on. Default off, per vault.
 *   2. the ACTION says its observations are worth keeping. A compatibility
 *      action never does — a derived contract cannot claim replayability, so
 *      the 123 pre-existing tools capture nothing even with the setting on.
 *   3. there is room under the size cap.
 *
 * The last one exists because retention does not: until a real retention pass
 * lands, an uncapped store grows forever, and "it filled the disk" is a worse
 * outcome than "it stopped recording and said so".
