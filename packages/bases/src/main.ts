// VAULT BASES — evaluated Base result sets for agents, as their own Obsidian
// plugin.
//
// Published to the Governor host through vault-mcp-api as two MCP tools:
//
//   vaultmcp_bases_list  — enumerate `.base` files + their declared views
//                       (read-only in intent; the host distrusts that claim,
//                       see below)
//   vaultmcp_bases_query — one declared view's rows, evaluated by Obsidian's own
//                       Bases engine in a hidden background leaf
//
// SATELLITE OF THE SUITE (suite-split design §6/§7, the "Bases | public
// optional | satellite" row). Extracted out of the host at S7, following the
// quickadd-choices-compile pilot and the private-tier satellites vaultmcp-skills
// (S4), vaultmcp-triage (S5) and vaultmcp-crosssession (S6). Consequences of the
// publishing contract, each deliberate:
//
//   * THE TOOL NAMES CHANGED TWICE OVER — `base_list` / `base_query` are now
//     `vaultmcp_bases_list` / `vaultmcp_bases_query`. The host publishes an external
//     tool as `<sanitized publisher id>_<bare name>`, so the plugin id IS the
//     namespace (`vaultmcp-bases` → `vaultmcp_bases`); and the bare names shed their
//     `base_` prefix, because keeping it would have published the stuttering
//     `vaultmcp_bases_base_query`. Recorded in CLAUDE.md and README.md, not buried
//     here.
//   * THE ALLOWLIST BOUNDARY MOVED TO THE HOST, and it lands ASYMMETRICALLY
//     here — unlike the three private-tier satellites, where it closed on the
//     whole surface. `list` takes no arguments, so under an active path
//     allowlist the host blocks it outright (stricter than the module, which
//     filtered its listing). `query` takes `path`, a recognized path key, so
//     the host scopes it instead of blocking it — but the ROW filter is now
//     dormant, so a query on a VISIBLE base can return rows naming notes
//     outside the allowlist, where the module dropped them. One tightened, one
//     loosened. See tools.ts and README.md; neither half is papered over.
//   * REFUSALS THROW; the host renders a thrown error's lowercase-snake `code`
//     as `Error [code]: message`, the envelope the module already produced.
//   * The host's queue, journal and kernel args still apply — external tools
//     ride the guarded registration path like every built-in, and an untrusted
//     `readOnly: true` claim means BOTH tools register as mutating.
//
// THIS PLUGIN NEEDS THE HOST, like the triage and cross-session satellites and
// unlike skills. It has no pane, no palette command and no ribbon: its entire
// surface is the two published tools. With Governor absent it loads, keeps and
// validates its settings, and does nothing — `publishTools` waits on the host's
// ready event and registers the moment a host appears. The settings tab says so
// plainly.
//
// ONE ADOPTION, not two. Config adoption is the skills/triage pattern, over the
// host's `modules.bases.config`. There is deliberately NO second adoption: this
// surface is read-only and holds no live operational state outside data.json —
// no receipts, no cache, no state file (checked, not assumed; see settings.ts).
//
// RE-PUBLISHING ON CONFIG CHANGE, as in the triage and cross-session
// satellites. Both tool DESCRIPTIONS render configured values — `query`'s
// renders the row cap and the query timeout — and the host snapshots a
// published spec when it registers it, so without a republish the descriptions
// would freeze at plugin load and a raised timeout would be misreported to
// every agent that reads the tool list. Disposing and re-publishing on every
// settings write restores the per-connection freshness the module had. It also
// re-evaluates the Bases feature gate, which is the one behaviour the
// extraction genuinely changed grain on — see the README.

/** The host plugin's ids, CURRENT FIRST — the same pair vault-mcp-api reads, in
 *  the same order, and for the same reason: the host id moved `vault-mcp` →
 *  `governor` at 0.12.0 and back to `vault-mcp` at the suite split's S3c.
 *  Used ONLY to find the settings to adopt from; publishing itself is entirely
 *  vault-mcp-api's business.
 *
 *  THE ORDER AND THE `api` CHECK BELOW ARE BOTH PART OF THE ANSWER. Post-split
 *  `app.plugins.plugins["governor"]` is the governance PROVIDER, which exposes
 *  no `api` object, so a bare-presence match over the old `["governor",
 *  "vault-mcp"]` order resolved the PROVIDER as the host — this satellite would
 *  then have adopted the provider's settings as the host's. The discriminator is
 *  vault-mcp-api's own (`getApi`, packages/vault-mcp-api/src/index.ts): a plugin
 *  counts as the host only if it exposes the api surface.
 *
 *  THE SUITE'S ONE BEHAVIOURAL TEST of this lookup is
 *  `packages/crosssession/tests/host-lookup.test.mjs`, over the extracted
 *  `packages/crosssession/src/host-lookup.ts` — same two lines, same reasoning,
 *  written out in full there. Nine identical suites would be nine copies of one
 *  assertion; a change here belongs in that file too. */
