// CAPTURE — Gate 0, WP2's vertical slice (D16).
//
// The point where the observation substrate stops being contracts and starts
// writing note text to disk. Everything here is about the conditions under
// which that happens, because the failure that matters is not "capture broke"
// — it is "capture happened when nobody asked for it".
//
// Three gates, and a read is captured only if all three agree:
//
//   1. the human turned it on. Default off, per vault. Capturing note bodies
//      is a privacy decision, and it is not one a plugin should make for
//      somebody by shipping it enabled.
//   2. the ACTION says its observations are worth keeping. A compatibility
//      action never does, so the 123 pre-existing tools capture nothing even
//      with the setting on — they are not native, and inventing an observation
//      contract for them would be the overclaim the adapter exists to prevent.
//   3. there is room under the size cap.
//
// The cap exists because retention does not, yet. Until a real retention pass
// lands, an uncapped store grows forever, and "it filled the disk" is a worse
// outcome than "it stopped recording and said so". The cap is a stopgap and is
// named as one.
//
// Nothing here may cost a caller their result. A capture failure — a full disk,
// a permissions error, a throwing store — degrades observability and is
// reported on the operation, exactly as the write journal already behaves.
