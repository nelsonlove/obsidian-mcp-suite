/**
 * conformance-rail-scope.test.mjs — #112: the rail governs LIVE content, not
 * the frozen archive (@assent's ruling, 2026-08-10).
 *
 * The ruling came with a condition: a **declared exclusion, not a silent
 * debt-clear**. Excluding a root makes every baseline key under it
 * unreproducible, so those keys would report CLEARED and quietly discard
 * accepted debt a human granted — the same failure the pack-coverage refusal
 * exists to stop, one level down (path granularity instead of pack).
 *
 * Measured before building: ZERO baseline keys fall under `Vault archaeology/`
 * today, under every pre-consolidation naming too (`_maybe`, `gen2`, `_keep`,
 * `_hold`, `_decent`). So the guarantee below costs nothing now — which is
 * exactly when it is cheap to add, and exactly the kind of fact that expires
 * silently if only a measurement records it.
