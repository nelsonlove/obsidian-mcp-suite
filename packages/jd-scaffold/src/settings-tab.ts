// settings-tab.ts — the plugin's own settings tab.
//
// It has NO SETTINGS TO RENDER, and that is correct: the jd-scaffold module
// declared no config block, so there is nothing to configure (see settings.ts).
// The tab ships anyway, and is worth shipping, because a user who installs this
// plugin needs to be told two things they cannot discover any other way:
//
//   1. It does nothing without the Governor host. The plugin's entire surface is
//      the seven MCP tools it publishes — no pane, no palette command, no
//      ribbon. With Governor absent it loads and sits there.
//   2. Under an ACTIVE Governor path allowlist, five of the seven are refused
//      outright and the two that name a note are scoped to it (round 2,
//      2026-09-07) — including reindex's ratified sibling-read residual.
//      That is deliberate and fail-closed (no argument here is a path key the
//      host can scope by), but a user watching every call refuse deserves to
//      know it is the posture rather than a bug.

    //     these seven tools to.
