// The declared NON-MCP SURFACE INVENTORY — Gate 0, WP0 (second half).
//
// MCP is one door onto the host. It is not the only one: commands are
// agent-invocable through `obsidian_run_command`'s `executeCommandById`,
// automation runs with no caller at all, and several of this plugin's most
// consequential acts write outside the vault on every load. An inventory that
// stopped at the bridge would omit all of them.
//
// Three kinds of door are declared here:
//
//   ui          an Obsidian command, a settings button — something a human
//               clicks
//   automation  a timer, a vault or metadata event subscription, a
//               layout-ready hook — work that starts with no caller at all
//   internal    a host-to-host call
//
// ── WHAT THE S3c SPLIT TOOK OUT OF THIS FILE ────────────────────────────────
//
// The ACCEPT PERIMETER left, whole, for
// `packages/governor/src/kernel/operations/inventory-authority.ts`. What went:
// `ACCEPT_PERIMETER_FUNCTIONS`, `WIRING_EXPORTS`, `AuthorityRow` and
// `AUTHORITY_SURFACES`, the `authorityAction` projector and its nine authored
// `AUTHORITY_ACTIONS`, the one automation row for the review pane's event
// wiring, the `internal.governance.publish-pending-index` row, and the whole
// `NOT_SURFACES` exclusion list — every one of them described a function inside
// `wiring.ts`, which is `packages/governor/src/wiring/wiring.ts` now and not
// host source at all.
//
// What that changed here, item by item, because none of it is cosmetic:
//
//   • `nonMcpActions()` no longer returns the authored authority actions; it
//     is commands + automation, and the provider's `authorityActions()` is the
//     other half. Both halves project their own rows exactly as the combined
//     function did.
//   • `nonMcpBindings()` no longer emits the authority bindings, so nothing
//     host-side binds a `governorOnly` action any more. The registry fence
//     (`authority_agent_surface`) is still HOST code and still the thing that
//     refuses; what moved is the only set of actions it has to refuse for, so
//     the test proving the fence is live moved with them.
//   • `AutomationRow.touchesAuthority` survives with no `true` left to carry.
//     It is now a claim every host row must make FALSE — authority-bearing
//     automation lives in the provider — and the host test pins that rather
//     than the old "backed by a fenced action" cross-reference, which needed
//     an authority list this package no longer has.
//   • `PlainSurfaceRow.reachesAuthority` still names an action id
//     (`settings.module-enabled` → `governance.rekey-baseline`), and the host
//     can no longer check that the id is a DECLARED authority action, because
//     the declaration is in the other package. The claim is not dropped: the
//     provider's test imports `PLAIN_SURFACES` from here and re-asserts it
//     there. That is the honest cost of the split — a claim about the host,
//     checked in the provider's suite, and lost entirely if the two ever stop
//     being able to import each other.
//
// The inverse-inventory property this file exists for is unchanged for what is
// left: every declared command must be registered, every registered command
// must be declared, every file that subscribes to an event or arms a timer
// must have a row.

// ── bridge, settings, and internal surfaces ──────────────────────────────────
//
// The last of WP0's inverse inventory. What counts as a SURFACE here, and what
// does not, matters — an inventory padded with every internal helper is as
// useless as one that omits a door.
//
// A surface is something a caller can invoke, something that runs by itself, or
// something that writes outside the vault. A function invoked only as the
// implementation of an already-declared action is NOT a surface; it is that
// action's body. `stampAcceptedFrontmatter`, `buildAcceptDeps`, `appendLog`,
// `saveAllowlist` and the baseline-store writers are all in that category —
// they are how `governance.accept` and its siblings do their work, and
// declaring them again would double-count one door.
//
// Two things in this section are easy to miss and worth stating plainly:
//
//   • `writeBridge()` and `autoRegister()` run on EVERY plugin load,
//     unconditionally — not gated on `settings.enabled`. Both write outside the
//     vault (`~/.claude/governor/`), and `autoRegister` spawns the `claude`
//     binary. A user who disables the socket still gets both.
//   • enabling the `acceptance` module from the settings tab mounts governance,
//     and mounting arms a one-shot `metadataCache "resolved"` handler that runs
//     `reconcileBaselines` — a declared authority action. A settings toggle is
//     therefore an authority-adjacent control, which is not obvious from
//     looking at the toggle.
