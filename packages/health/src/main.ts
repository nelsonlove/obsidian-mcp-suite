// VAULT HEALTH — the vault-health scanner as its own Obsidian plugin.
//
// Published to the Governor host through vault-mcp-api as two MCP tools:
//
//   vault_health_scan — the full tiered health scan → structured findings
//                       (read-only in intent; the host distrusts that claim,
//                       see below);
//   vault_health_lint — the same scan, findings restricted to one folder/note.
//
// SATELLITE OF THE SUITE (suite-split design §6). Extracted out of the host at
// S7, following the quickadd-choices-compile pilot, the vault-skills satellite
// (S4), vault-triage (S5) and vault-crosssession (S6). Consequences of the
// publishing contract, each deliberate:
//
//   * THE PUBLISHED TOOL NAMES CHANGED — `obsidian_health` → `vault_health_scan`
//     and `obsidian_lint` → `vault_health_lint`. The host publishes an external
//     tool as `<sanitized publisher id>_<bare name>`, so the plugin id IS the
//     tool namespace; `vault-health` sanitizes to `vault_health`. The bare names
//     shed `obsidian_` because that prefix was the HOST's built-in namespace,
//     never this module's own name — keeping it would publish a tool named after
//     two owners (`vault_health_obsidian_health`). That WAS available: F1 tests
//     the PUBLISHED name, which would not have started with `obsidian_`. So this
//     is a choice, not a constraint, and it is breaking for callers. Recorded in
//     CLAUDE.md with the one-line reversal.
//   * THE ALLOWLIST BOUNDARY MOVED TO THE HOST, and for this surface it closes
//     harder than the module's NON-filtering it replaces: neither tool carries a
//     recognized path key (`scan` takes no arguments at all; `lint`'s `scope` is
//     not a `PATH_KEY`), so under an active path allowlist the host blocks both
//     outright. Fail-closed. That is what resolves issue #381 for these two
//     tools — see README.md. See tools.ts for why `scope` was deliberately NOT
//     renamed into a path key.
//   * REFUSALS THROW; the host renders a thrown error's lowercase-snake `code`
//     as `Error [code]: message`, the envelope the module already produced.
//   * The host's read-only mode, queue, journal and kernel args still apply —
//     external tools whose read-only claim is untrusted ride the guarded
//     registration path like every built-in mutating tool.
//
// THIS PLUGIN NEEDS THE HOST, like the triage and crosssession satellites. It has
// no pane, no palette command and no ribbon: its entire surface is the two
// published tools. With Governor absent it loads, keeps its settings, adopts
// nothing, and does nothing — `publishTools` waits on the host's ready event and
// registers the moment a host appears. The settings tab says so plainly.
//
// ONE ADOPTION, not two. Unlike the crosssession satellite there is NO live
// operator state to migrate: the health module kept nothing on disk — no
// receipts, no baseline, no cursor — because every call recomputes the whole scan
// from Obsidian's live metadata cache and the notes themselves. The host's
// `modules.health.config` is the entire migration surface.
//
// RE-PUBLISHING ON CONFIG CHANGE, as in the triage and crosssession satellites,
// and here it is load-bearing twice over. Both tool DESCRIPTIONS render the
// configured empty-note threshold, and the host snapshots a published spec when
// it registers it — so without a republish the number an agent reads would freeze
// at plugin load. Disposing and re-publishing on every settings write restores
// the per-connection freshness the module had. (The HANDLERS read the config
// through a thunk, per call — see tools.ts, where that is the S7 bug fix.)
