// host-shim.mjs — a stand-in for the Vault MCP host's external-tool
// registration, so this package's handler-level tests exercise the ENVELOPES an
// agent actually sees. (Not a `*.test.mjs` file — the test glob skips it.)
//
// Since S3c these five tools are no longer registered on an `McpServer` inside
// the host. They are PUBLISHED through `vault-mcp-api` as `SdkToolSpec[]`, and a
// published tool's handler returns plain data or throws: the host turns the
// first into `ok(data)` and the second into `fail(err)`, where `fail` renders a
// lowercase-snake `code` off the error as `Error [code]: message`. That is the
// contract `src/tools/*.ts` is now written against, so testing the raw handlers
// alone would leave the refusal shape — the thing the old `codedError` used to
// guarantee — unpinned.
//
// This shim reproduces exactly FOUR host behaviours and nothing else. The first
// three are `packages/crosssession/tests/host-shim.mjs`'s, verbatim in intent;
// the fourth is this package's alone.
//
//   1. THE PUBLISHED NAME, including THE EXACT-NAME TABLE. The ordinary rule is
//      `<sanitized owner id>_<bare name>` and this plugin's id is `governor`, so
//      a new tool would publish as `governor_<name>`. These five do not: the host
//      carries a closed table naming both the spelling AND the single owner id
//      allowed to publish it bare, so `governance_revisions` stays
//      `governance_revisions` rather than becoming
//      `governor_governance_revisions`. The table below is a SNAPSHOT of the
//      host's (`packages/host/src/mcp/external-tools.ts`), carried as DATA. The
//      pin that SHOULD fire when the host's table changes is the host's own test
//      over the live `GRANDFATHERED_TOOL_NAMES` / `publishedToolName`, never this
//      copy — and as of 2026-09-08 THAT TEST DOES NOT EXIST: the host's
//      `external-tools.test.mjs` covers F1 only through the ungrandfathered case
//      (owner `obsidian-read` + name `note`), and neither it nor
//      `packages/vault-mcp-api/tests/` names any of the five spellings. So this
//      snapshot is currently the ONLY place the five names are asserted, which
//      makes it a review aid doing a tripwire's job. Named here rather than
//      quietly relied on: the host owes the live pin.
//   2. THE ENVELOPE. `ok` / `fail`, including `fail`'s coded rendering and its
//      lowercase-snake gate (a Node error's UPPERCASE `.code` renders plain), so
//      a `GovernanceRefusal` is asserted as the agent-visible
//      `Error [code]: message` string rather than as a thrown object.
//   3. THE ANNOTATIONS the host derives from an UNTRUSTED `readOnly` claim.
//      `readOnlyHint: true` from a publisher is an assertion about code the host
//      cannot inspect, so it is believed only when the RAW plugin id is listed in
//      `trustedReadOnlyPlugins` (empty by default). Untrusted ⇒ registered as
//      MUTATING, which is why `governance_mandates`, `governance_revisions` and
//      `governance_pending_review` are blocked in read-only mode despite reading
//      nothing. `trusted: true` opts into believing the claim, for the tests that
//      pin the difference. The base presets are `@vault-mcp/core`'s
//      SHARED_ANNOTATIONS RO/RW, reproduced literally — note `destructiveHint`
//      defaults to FALSE on both, and only an explicit `destructive` on the spec
//      overrides it.
//   4. F1 — THE `obsidian_*` NAMESPACE REFUSAL, UNCONDITIONAL, WITH NO BYPASS.
//
// ── WHY POINT 4 SAYS "NO BYPASS", AND WHY THAT SENTENCE MATTERS ─────────────
//
// The first draft of this shim reproduced an F1 CARVE-OUT, because the first
// draft of the host's table held `obsidian_pending_review` and let that one name
// through the reserved namespace. **Nelson ruled against it on 2026-09-08 and
// the tool was RENAMED to `governance_pending_review` instead.** The reasoning
// binds anything that comes here next: an F1 exception, even one gated on a
// provider id, permanently weakens a namespace-integrity rule and becomes the
// precedent for the next exception; the locked decision forbids renames "for
// zero semantic gain" and this rename HAS gain, because the `obsidian_` prefix
// branded a governance tool as a host built-in, which after the split is an
// architectural lie; and the breakage is near zero, since MCP tools are
// discovered per session.
//
// So the table below and F1 are TWO SEPARATE RULES and this shim keeps them
// separate: the table carves out the OWNER-PREFIXING rule only, and F1 refuses a
// published `obsidian_*` name whoever asks, including a name the table lists.
// There is deliberately no dormant exception branch to reactivate. A test plants
// a violation against each half, because a carve-out assertion that would pass
// under a shim that never refuses anything asserts nothing.
//
// This shim deliberately does NOT reproduce the F3 pathless-tool block, the path
// allowlist, the write queue, the write journal, read-only mode, the kernel
// arguments, or the record-immutability guard. Those are host code with host
// tests, and a second copy could drift into asserting a posture the host does
// not enforce. What this package DOES pin about them is the only half it owns —
// which of its arguments the host would recognize as a path (see
// `publication.test.mjs`).
