/**
 * conformance-golive.test.mjs — #116: the conformance CLI's gate default and
 * its rebaseline guard.
 *
 * Two defects this pins, both measured live on the restored baseline:
 *
 * 1. The legacy gate was INVERTED relative to the baseline it is measured
 *    against. The accepted-debt baseline's keys are exclusively legacy-pack
 *    keys, and the legacy packs defaulted OFF — so the default run cleared the
 *    ENTIRE baseline (124 of 124) on every invocation. A pack set that cannot
 *    produce any of the baseline's keys is not a conservative default, it is a
 *    guaranteed false "everything was fixed" report.
 *
 * 2. `PHASE1_PACKS_INCOMPLETE` was a hardcoded `true` whose stated reason
 *    ("drift_audit is unported") became FALSE when the drift pack landed. A
 *    constant that encodes a fact about the pack set has to be COMPUTED from
 *    the pack set, or it goes stale silently and starts refusing (or, worse,
 *    permitting) for a reason that no longer holds.
 *
 * The refusal is deliberately NOT reduced to pack coverage alone: rebaselining
 * the live baseline re-accepts current findings, and acceptance is human-only.
 * Coverage is an ADDITIONAL check that also protects fixture baselines.
