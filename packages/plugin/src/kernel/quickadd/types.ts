// (mcp/tools-quickadd.ts); everything here works on already-resolved data.

 *  `choiceId` is that note's OWN compiler-owned id (deriveChoiceId of the

 *  waiting for that note to be compiled itself, since ids are a pure
 *  function of note path. Whether the referenced note actually compiles
 *  into a valid choice is NOT checked here — same discipline QuickAdd's
 *  own data.json uses (choiceId is just a stored reference; a dangling one
 *  fails at RUN time, not compile time). Reference CYCLES are the one
 *  exception, and they are caught after the fact rather than here: see
 *  `detectChoiceCycles` in transform.ts, which runs over the whole compiled
 *  set once every note's steps are resolved.
 *
 *  `displayName` is the TARGET note's own display name, derived exactly the
 *  way a choice note's own name is (frontmatter `name:` if it is a non-empty
 *  string, else the basename with `.md` stripped). A native QuickAdd Choice
 *  command stores the referenced choice's name there, not a generic label —
 *  and QuickAdd's own dangling-reference failure path logs
 *  `choice '<command.name>' could not be found.`, so a generic label would
 *  name nothing useful at run time. */

 *  frontmatter field that could drift from the real command name.
 *
 *  That resolution is a COMPILE-TIME SNAPSHOT: if the plugin providing the
 *  command is later disabled, the next compile fails this step and therefore
 *  drops the whole choice from QuickAdd's live config (deregistering its
 *  Obsidian command) on the strength of another plugin's load state rather
 *  than any edit to the note. That is ACCEPTED, not mitigated — it is the
