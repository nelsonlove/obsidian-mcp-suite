// ============================================================================
//  DISPOSITIONS AS DATA — the acceptance instance's declared disposition set
//  (#101, phase 1 of #221)
// ----------------------------------------------------------------------------
//  Every verb the governance surface offers is DECLARED here as a descriptor:
//  `{ id, authority, surface, label, effect, … }`. The pane renders its human
//  controls from this set (membership, order, labels) and the one agent verb's
//  tool name is derived from it — so "what dispositions exist, and who may
//  exercise each" is a reviewable data table, not knowledge scattered across
//  button-creation call sites.
//
//  THE AUTHORITY AXIS (#221): a disposition that confers standing — that decides
//  what enters or leaves the accepted knowledge base — is `authority: "human"`
//  and exists ONLY as a gesture-gated pane control (addEventListener +
//  isRealGesture; see gesture.ts and governance/pane.ts). A mechanical,
//  reversible write that merely SUPPLIES a candidate is `authority: "agent"`
//  and exists ONLY as an ordinary guarded MCP tool. Nothing here changes the
//  gating: descriptors are DATA. Deliberately:
//
//    - NO callable rides a descriptor. `effect` is a documentation string, not
//      a function — an accept-capable callable on module-exported data would be
//      exactly the app-walkable accept gadget the reachability invariant
//      (governance/wiring.ts header) forbids.
//    - NO registry / plugin API for third-party dispositions. The set below is
//      frozen; extending it is a reviewed code change, same as
//      AUTHORIZED_CLASSES (auto-accept/classes.ts).
//
//  Obsidian-free, pure data — headless-testable (tests/governance-
//  dispositions.test.mjs pins completeness + authority classes).
//
//  The GENERIC descriptor shape was extracted to the disposition substrate
//  (kernel/triage/dispositions.ts — #221 phase 2) once the shape had survived
//  contact here; this file keeps the ACCEPTANCE-SPECIFIC halves — the closed
//  id/surface unions, the frozen seven-verb table, and the accept-effect
//  display text — and its exports are unchanged (same names, same shapes,
//  same behavior). The substrate types are referenced through inline
//  `import(…)` TYPE positions only, deliberately: this file stays a
//  pure-data LEAF with no import statement and no runtime module edge (the
//  governance tripwire pins that), so the shared shape binds at compile time
//  while reachability is exactly what it was. The substrate's generic
//  helpers are equivalent to the one-line filters below (the triage instance
//  uses the shared ones; the equivalence is pinned by test).
