// HISTORY STORE TYPES — repository-neutral object and ref contracts (WP4).
//
// D10: one vault-root repository, identity belonging to the vault. These types
// are what the proposal and admission services program against; the live
// isomorphic-git adapter implements them, and D08 keeps everything here
// INTERNAL — ref names, layouts, and these shapes carry no external
// compatibility promise. What IS promised externally is standard Git object
// compatibility: every object a repository stores must be readable by stock
// git. The committed tests exercise round-trips through the adapter and
// refuse the malformed inputs that would produce fsck-rejected trees; the
// stock-git read-back itself (cat-file, log, fsck) was proven in the WP4
// dependency spike rather than in this suite, which deliberately does not
// depend on a system git binary.
