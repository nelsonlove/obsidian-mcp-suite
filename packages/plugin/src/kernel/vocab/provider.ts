// provider.ts — the VocabularyProvider contract: the seam between the kernel's
// vocab-agnostic term operations and a concrete controlled-vocabulary source.
// The registry blueprints (blueprint.ts) and the glossary (glossary.ts) are the
// first implementations; other sources plug in behind the same shape later.
// Kernel-module rules apply: nothing here imports from "obsidian", not even
// types — every provider is pure and unit-testable without a vault.
//
// The counterpart split (scope-provider design doc, "The primitives"): the
// scope provider's grammar ranges over ITEM IDENTITIES (addresses); this
// module's ranges over CLASSIFICATION TOKENS — registered tags, property keys,
// type names, glossary terms. A provider never mints identity and never
// mutates a note: validation and resolution only.

 *   - hierarchical: entries nest (tag namespaces, type `extends` chains).
