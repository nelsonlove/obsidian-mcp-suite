/**
 * territory-policy.test.mjs — the host's three territory decisions (#396/#397),
 * ruled 2026-09-22: no shipped list, empty guards nothing, capture refuses on
 * empty, and the legacy seed is written ONCE into an upgrading install.
 *
 * Two halves. The first tests the pure functions. The second pins, by source
 * scan, that production actually calls them — because the defect this repo
 * keeps finding is a setting that exists with nothing proving a path reads it
 * (#397 itself: the territory list was threaded through `SnapshotOpts` and no
 * production caller passed it).
