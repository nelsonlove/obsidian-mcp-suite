// visibility.ts — the path-allowlist visibility predicate, published as a
// contract at the skills satellite extraction (suite split, S4).
//
// WHY IT LIVES IN CORE. `isVisible` was born in the host's `src/guard.ts` and
// is the one rule every disclosing surface asks: "may this session be told
// about this path?" The skills compiler's preview filter asks it too, and the
// skills compiler is now its own plugin. The alternative was a second copy of
// the predicate inside the satellite — the drift this repo has already paid
// for twice (the accept-guard recognizer, the guarded-territory prefix list),
// and a guard predicate is exactly the wrong thing to fork: a copy that
// normalizes differently is a bypass nobody notices until it is a leak.
//
// It is a pure function over (path, settings) and `GuardSettings` is the kind
// of small published shape core already carries (SessionV1, the disposition
// descriptors, EXCLUDED_PREFIXES). Nothing here imports obsidian, the MCP SDK,
// or anything host-side.
//
// The host's `guard.ts` keeps `guardCall`, `visiblePaths`, `mapPaths` and
// `collectPaths` — those know the tool surface's ARGUMENT shapes, which is
// host knowledge — and re-exports this type so its own importers are
// unchanged. `guardCall`'s allowlist branch is defined over `isVisible`, so the
// one-path answer and the whole-call answer cannot disagree.
