// The declared AUTHORITY SURFACE INVENTORY — Gate 0, WP0, provider half.
//
// This is the half of the old `inventory-non-mcp.ts` that declares the ACCEPT
// PERIMETER. It moved here at S3c, when `packages/plugin` became
// `packages/host` plus `packages/governor` and the functions this file
// describes stopped being host source: they live in `src/wiring/wiring.ts` of
// THIS package now, so a file in the host that claimed to describe them was
// describing a tree the host no longer has.
//
// What the move cost, said plainly: the old file could compute one registry
// over commands, automation and authority together, and one test could assert
// that the whole non-MCP surface validated as a set. That set is now two sets
// in two packages, and nothing checks them jointly at runtime — the joint
// claim survives only because the provider's test imports the host's registry
// and its MCP inventory across the package boundary and re-asserts the
// cross-package parts there. When the two packages stop sharing a worktree,
// that import is the thing that breaks, and the claims it carries are the ones
// that will need republishing as contracts.
//
// Three kinds of door are declared here, the same three the combined inventory
// named:
//
//   ui          a review-pane control or a settings button — something a human
//               clicks
//   automation  a vault or metadata event subscription, or the journal poll —
//               work that starts with no caller at all
//   internal    a Governor-to-Governor call
//
// The AUTHORITY rows are the point of the exercise. They are the only actions
// in this suite declared `governorOnly` with the `authority` change class, and
// the host's `registry.ts` refuses at build time to bind any of them to an
// `mcp` or `external` surface. That is the static counterpart to the two
// runtime controls the pane already enforces: every capability-bearing control
// is wired with `addEventListener` rather than `.onclick =` (so the function is
// not a reachable property), and every handler calls `isRealGesture(evt)`,
// which requires a genuine `Event` with `isTrusted === true`.
//
// Two structural facts this inventory depends on are asserted by its test
// rather than assumed, because both are load-bearing and neither was checked
// by anything before:
//
//   • `src/wiring/` registers ZERO Obsidian commands. Every command is
//     agent-invocable through `obsidian_run_command`'s `executeCommandById`,
//     so an accept command would be a self-approval primitive one
//     prompt-injection away. Note what the split did to this one: the host's
//     scanner filtered its own tree for `src/governor/wiring/`, a prefix that
//     no longer exists there, so after the move it matched nothing and passed
//     for the wrong reason. An emptiness claim that cannot fail is not a
//     claim, so the scan now runs over THIS package's tree and its test plants
//     a command inside `src/wiring/` to prove the scan still sees one.
//   • none of the ten accept-perimeter functions is exported, and the file's
//     export set is pinned. Export is what would make one reachable from a
//     plugin instance, a view instance, or any other object an agent-facing
//     path can obtain — and pinning the whole set closes the class rather than
//     the ten instances.
//
// WHY THIS FILE REACHES INTO `packages/host/src` RATHER THAN A PUBLISHED
// CONTRACT. S3c's rule for a provider→host dependency is `@vault-mcp/core`'s
// `action-contract.ts`: publish the part two plugins must agree on
// BYTE-FOR-BYTE, because a second copy of it would be a correctness bug —
// `CHANGE_CLASSES` (whose order feeds subject hashing) and `NOTE_WRITE_ACTION`
// (whose identity the write observer matches on) qualify, and were published.
//
// `ActionDefinition`, `compatibilityAction` and `SurfaceBinding` do not, and
// publishing them to satisfy this file would drag most of the registry's
// vocabulary into a shared package to serve a declaration that no shipped code
// path reads. This file is imported by its test and by nothing under `src/`,
// exactly like the host's `inventory-non-mcp.ts` — so the crossing costs the
// built plugin nothing, and a relative path that a reader can follow is a
// smaller lie than a "contract" invented for one importer. It becomes a real
// work item the day the two packages stop sharing a worktree, and the honest
// statement until then is that this is a test-time dependency on host source.

/**
 * The module-scope functions in `wiring/wiring.ts` that can change authority
 * state. Named here so the test can assert they still exist and are still
 * unexported — an inventory that describes deleted code is worse than none,
 * and an exported one is a hole.
 *
 * `wiring.ts`'s own header gives the membership test: "A capability that
 * advances a baseline, accepts a change, adopts a baseline, or flips an
 * auto-accept class is accept-equivalent: it silences the review queue."
 * Applied literally, that is every writer of `setBaseline`, `rekey` or the
 * auto-accept allowlist. There are ten.
 *
 * The first draft of this list had seven, and the three it missed are the
 * three with NO gesture anywhere:
 *
 *   maybeAutoAccept     advances a baseline for an allowlisted mechanical
 *                       class, driven by a 2.5s poll — no click, no
 *                       isRealGesture, nothing
 *   sweepAutoAccept     its driver, over the cached pending queue
 *   reconcileBaselines  re-addresses baselines whose notes moved while the
 *                       plugin was off
 *
 * Missing them is instructive rather than embarrassing: the gesture-gated
 * capabilities are easy to find because a human clicks them, and the ones that
 * run by themselves are exactly the ones an inventory built by reading the UI
 * will overlook.
