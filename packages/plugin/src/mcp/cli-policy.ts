// cli-policy.ts — the settings-driven command allow/deny policy for the two
// arbitrary-execution surfaces, closing the accept-scar's last residual.
//
// The accept-forbidden guard (write-notes-compose.ts, cliAcceptRefusal) covers
// every INSPECTABLE write: MCP primitives, CLI property sets, CLI content
// writes. What it cannot cover is opaque execution — `quickadd` macros, `eval`,
// `command`, and `obsidian_run_command` ids — where acceptance could be set
// inside code the guard never sees. Until now that was a documented residual;
// this module closes it by FAILING CLOSED: the opaque-accept set is DENIED by
// default, and re-enabling a specific command is a HUMAN-ONLY act (a plugin
// setting, reachable through the Obsidian settings tab / data.json). The
// human-only property is enforced, not assumed: the MCP write primitives
// refuse non-`.md` paths structurally; the opaque surfaces that could write
// settings from inside (`eval`/`command`/quickadd macros) are what this
// policy denies by default; and the CLI proxy's own param values are barred
// from `.obsidian` territory by `configPathRefusal` below, so the inspectable
// CLI write commands cannot target data.json either — whatever the external
// binary's path handling turns out to be.
//
// Policy semantics, in evaluation order:
//   1. `deny` (settings) — always refused. Deny BEATS allow: a command both
//      denied and re-enabled is refused, so a hand-edited data.json cannot be
//      talked into a contradictory state that fails open.
//   2. The built-in opaque-accept set — refused unless the human re-enabled
//      that specific entry via `allowOpaque`.
//   3. Everything else — allowed by this policy (the existing danger gate and
//      accept guard still apply downstream; this policy COMPOSES with them,
//      it replaces nothing. `eval`/`command` re-enabled here still need the
//      "Allow dangerous CLI commands" toggle — two locks, both human).
//
// Entries are exact command names, or prefix globs written `prefix*` (used as
// `quickadd:*` for run_command ids). Matching is case-sensitive on purpose,
// like the danger gate: the CLI's commands are lowercase, and a
// case-insensitive match here could diverge from the case-sensitive gates
// downstream.
//
// Pure and obsidian-free: unit-tested directly; the tool handlers call the
// two refusal functions with the settings-supplied policy.
