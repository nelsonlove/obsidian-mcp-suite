// obsidian_quickadd_compile — Stage A of "QuickAdd macros as notes"
// (docs/superpowers/specs/2026-08-18-quickadd-macros-as-notes-design.md).
// Discovers Macro/UserScript choice notes by frontmatter, resolves their
// wikilinks, feeds the pure transform (kernel/quickadd/transform.ts), and
// applies the result via QuickAdd's own saveSettings() — vault-mcp is a
// full Obsidian plugin, so no raw data.json parsing is needed.
//
// The write is a SCOPED MERGE, never a full overwrite: only choices whose
// id carries the qan: compiler-owned prefix (see transform.ts) are
// replaced/added/removed. Every other choice in QuickAdd's live config —
// hand-authored, or managed by another mechanism entirely (e.g. the vault's
// own sync-quickadd-choices.js during the migration window) — passes
// through completely untouched. This is what lets Stage A ship before
// every choice in the vault is migrated to a note.
//
// saveSettings() alone writes data.json but does NOT make a choice runnable:
// QuickAdd registers each command-bearing choice as an Obsidian command
// itself, via its own public addCommandForChoice/removeCommandForChoice.
// So the apply path mirrors QuickAdd's own updateCommand (remove-then-add)
// over the compiler-owned set — see applyCommands below.
