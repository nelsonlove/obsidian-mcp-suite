/**
 * conformance-drift-pack.test.mjs — the drift rule pack (drift ← drift_audit.py)
 * as it stands after #412 retired the checks that measured a vault shape the
 * rebuilt vault no longer has: A, B, D, F and G are gone; E (duplicate uid)
 * and J (category-number collisions on the System spine) remain.
 *
 * The drift pack maps each Python finding string `"{LETTER}: {rest}"` onto the
 * canonical 4-tuple Finding keyed BYTE-IDENTICAL to the ratchet's `parse_drift`:
 *   { script: "drift_audit", check: <LETTER>, target: <rest>, kind: "" }
 * for J; E's Python message embeds volatile data (an order-dependent homes
 * list), so `parse_drift`'s docstring keys it on the uid alone (target <uid>,
 * kind "dup-uid") — the accepted-debt baseline's keys carry across the port
 * AND stay stable under unrelated edits (issue #136: keying E on the raw
 * message text produces a permanent false-NEW treadmill, since the message
 * changes on every additional claimant).
 *
 * Both surviving checks are exercised here, plus a clean fixture, the empty
 * `kind`, the E traversal-order + scope edges, the KEY STABILITY test for E,
 * and the #412 retirement pins: the retired letters are never emitted, the
 * pack reads only `systemRoot`, and the listings the retired checks needed
 * (`files`, `obsidianConfig`) are no longer required.
