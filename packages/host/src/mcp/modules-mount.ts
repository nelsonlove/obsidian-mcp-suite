// modules-mount.ts — the module host's mount: the built-in capability modules
// assembled as VaultModules and registered THROUGH the ModuleRegistry (ruled
// decision #2 realized — they are settings-toggleable units behind the host's
// tripwire/collision checks, no longer direct registerXTools calls in
// server.ts).
//
// Pure and headless-testable: no `obsidian` imports — the vault-facing
// dependencies arrive injected via MountDeps, exactly as tools-scheme already
// takes them; server.ts contributes only the live adapters and the patched
// registerTool. MountDeps is down to two fields — the settings thunk and the
// scheme module's note listing — because the nine modules that needed their
// own adapters all left for their own plugins.
//
// ── The hard security gate this file answers (recorded by the orchestrator
//    on the module-host merge; verified by test where testable) ─────────────
//
//  1. HANDLER reachability: every tool a module contributes is
//     `readOnlyHint: true` UNLESS the module itself declares `mutating: true`
//     — a read-only registration cannot reach the write queue, the write
//     primitive, or the accept-guard's territory at all (the guard routes
//     ONLY `readOnlyHint === false` calls to the kernel's mutation path).
//     `mutating: true` is a real, deliberate escape hatch, not a bypass of
//     this gate — a module that does NOT declare it still gets the original
//     all-read-only enforcement. NO module declares it today: provenance,
//     fileclass and jd-scaffold were the three that did, and all three left
//     as satellite plugins at the suite split's mutating tier. The flag, this
//     gate's branch and their tests are kept rather than deleted — a
//     documented module-host capability with three shipped users behind it,
//     not perimeter surface that was never used — so a module needing it
//     again declares it exactly as they did. Pinned by test: the mount's
//     registerAll gate refuses a non-mutating module's tool whose
//     annotations are not read-only (see `mountModules`), so a future module
//     slipping a mutating handler in without the declaration fails loudly (a
//     `problems` entry, surfaced by server.ts) rather than registering
//     quietly.
//  2. The host ctx handed to modules is MINIMAL: `getSettings` + `visible`
//     and nothing else — no kernel, no raw server, no registerTool, no
//     baseline/accept surface. Pinned by test over `mountHost`'s keys.
//  3. Modules register ONLY through the registry: server.ts no longer calls
//     registerSchemeTools directly (pinned by a source scan in the test
//     suite), so the tripwire and collision checks cannot be bypassed for
//     module tools. (The same scan used to name registerVocabTools; the vocab
//     module left for the `vaultmcp-vocab` satellite at S7.)
//  4. Capability modules only — nothing here declares (or could smuggle) a
//     governance posture; the registry refuses that posture at construction
//     anyway.

// ── the vocab module manifest USED TO LIVE HERE ─────────────────────────────
//
// Removed at the read-tier satellite extraction (suite split, S7), with the
// health and bases manifests below it, for the same reason the skills manifest
// left at S4, triage's at S5 and cross-session's at S6: controlled-vocabulary
// validation is now a separate plugin (`packages/vocab`, id `vaultmcp-vocab`)
// publishing through the external-tool registry. Its four tools are on the
// wire as `vaultmcp_vocab_vocabularies` / `_resolve_term` / `_validate_terms` /
// `_list_vocabulary` — the plugin id IS the tool namespace, so the `obsidian_`
// spellings are gone.
//
// TWO THINGS DID NOT LEAVE WITH IT, and both are deliberate:
//
//   • THE KERNEL. `src/kernel/vocab/` moved to `@vault-mcp/core`, not into the
//     satellite, because the host's conformance rail is its second consumer
//     (`conformance/packs/vocab.ts` wraps `noteVocabFindings`,
//     `conformance/cli.ts` builds a `VocabRegistry` per run). Same shape as the
//     `queryBaseRows` question at S5, same forbidden answer: two copies of a
//     rule core is how one vault gets two vocabularies.
//   • THE SETTING. `settings.vocabularies` is a TOP-LEVEL host setting, not a
//     `modules.vocab.config` row, and since S7 it is MIGRATION-ONLY: the field
//     stays declared as the satellite's one-shot adoption source, and nothing
//     in the host reads it any more. An earlier draft of this comment said
//     conformance keeps it live — WRONG, and worth recording because the error
//     is re-derivable: the rail's three `runConformance` call sites all pass
//     `DEFAULT_VOCABULARIES` unconditionally and always have (drift-source,
//     debt-source, cli). See `packages/vocab/CLAUDE.md`, which records the
//     same correction.
//
// ── the provenance module manifest USED TO LIVE HERE ───────────────────────
//
// Removed at the MUTATING-tier satellite extraction, with the fileclass and
// jd-scaffold manifests below it. Derived-content provenance is now
// `packages/provenance` (id `vaultmcp-provenance`), publishing
// `vaultmcp_provenance_check` / `_reconcile` / `_regen` — the plugin id IS the
// tool namespace, and the bare names shed the `provenance_` prefix so nothing
// published as `vaultmcp_provenance_provenance_check`. Its three config fields
// (`notesDir`, `notesSource`, `auditNote`) moved to that plugin's own settings
// tab and are adopted once out of `modules.provenance.config`.
//
// One argument changed with them, and it is a scoping decision rather than a
// spelling one: `check`'s `path` became `note_path` at the extraction and is
// now spelled `note` (round 2, 2026-09-07). `path` is a key this guard
// recognizes, so keeping it would have let a session under a path allowlist run
// the check scoped to the note it names — while the answer still listed every
// path that note's `derived-from` globs resolve to. `note_path` is a key too
// SINCE ROUND 1 (see guard.ts), which briefly re-opened exactly that; round 2
// settled the rule — kernel visibility is a MUTATING concern, so a read that
// can name out-of-allowlist paths goes pathless while a mutating tool that
// names a note keeps `note_path`. `check` is a read, so it is `note`, and no
// tool in that plugin carries a recognized path key: F3 blocks all three
// outright under an allowlist. Fail-closed.
//
// ── the health module manifest USED TO LIVE HERE ────────────────────────────
//
// Removed at the read-tier satellite extraction (suite split, S7). The vault
// health scan is now `packages/health` (id `vaultmcp-health`), publishing
// `vaultmcp_health_scan` and `vaultmcp_health_lint`. Its one config field
// (`emptyChars`) moved to that plugin's own settings tab and is adopted once
// out of `modules.health.config`.
//
// Worth recording because it closes an open issue: #381 asked whether the
// whole-vault read exception had grown by precedent rather than by decision,
// and named `obsidian_health` as one of three tools scanning the entire vault
// with no allowlist filtering. For these two the question is now moot — as
// untrusted external tools carrying no recognized path-key argument they are
// blocked WHOLESALE while a path allowlist is active, which is stricter than
// the documented-exception outcome the issue was weighing. The issue's list is
// down to `provenance_reconcile` and `obsidian_conformance_debt`, both still
// here.
//
// ── the fileclass module manifest USED TO LIVE HERE ────────────────────────
//
// Removed at the MUTATING-tier satellite extraction. The fileclass CLI proxy is
// now `packages/fileclass` (id `vaultmcp-fileclass`), publishing
// `vaultmcp_fileclass_list` / `_schema` / `_explain` / `_query` / `_get` /
// `_validate` / `_set` / `_set_where` — the bare names shed the `fileclass_`
// prefix so nothing published as `vaultmcp_fileclass_fileclass_list`. Its one
// config field (`binaryPath`) moved to that plugin's own settings tab and is
// adopted once out of `modules.fileclass.config`.
//
// The DOUBLE GATE went with it and still holds: nothing is published unless the
// Fileclass plugin is loaded AND the CLI binary resolves. Only its grain
// changed — publish time rather than per connection build.
//
// Its whole-surface allowlist refusal is the reason the mutating tier renamed
// its note arguments away from `path`. The module refused every one of its
// eight tools while an allowlist was active, because the CLI runs its engine
// over the whole vault and its output cannot be attributed to paths; a
// satellite cannot make that check, so the host's F3 gate had to do it instead.
// After round 2 (2026-09-07) that reproduction is SEVEN of the eight: the two
// reads that name a note spell it `note` and are refused with the five pathless
// ones, while `set` spells it `note_path` — a key — so the host scopes that one
// write per-path and the kernel's record guard sees the note it rewrites. The
// asymmetry is deliberate: a read gains nothing from kernel visibility, a write
// does.
//
// NOT related, and easy to confuse: `obsidian_fileclass_schema` /
// `obsidian_fileclass_insert_fields` in tools-integrations.ts are for the
// metadata-menu plugin. They stay here and were untouched by the extraction.
//
// ── THE ACCEPTANCE MODULE MANIFEST USED TO LIVE HERE ─────────────────────────
//
// Removed at the host/provider split (S3c). The acceptance capability was never
// an MCP surface — its registrar was a NO-OP on the transport, and its whole job
// was to carry an `enabled` flag and a `config` block for a review pane that
// `main.ts` wired somewhere else entirely. Both halves of that are the
// governance PROVIDER's now: the flag, the five config fields (the two badge
// toggles, `acceptedBy`, `gateMode`, `requiredFrontmatterKeys`) and the
// gesture-gated allowlist controls the module rendered itself all live in
// `packages/governor`, in the provider's own `data.json` and its own settings
// tab.
//
// A `modules.acceptance` row surviving in the HOST's `data.json` is therefore an
// UNKNOWN MODULE ID, reported by the skip-and-report below and never mounted.
// That is deliberate and harmless: the row is the provider's adoption source and
// the host must not silently claim it.
//
// ── the bases module manifest USED TO LIVE HERE ─────────────────────────────
//
// Removed at the read-tier satellite extraction (suite split, S7). Evaluated
// Base rows are now `packages/bases` (id `vaultmcp-bases`), publishing
// `vaultmcp_bases_list` and `vaultmcp_bases_query`.
//
// THE CAPTURE SEAM WENT WITH IT, and that is the decision worth carrying. At
// S5 the triage module's base-backed queues were cut loose rather than take
// `queryBaseRows` along, because the capture drives a hidden Bases leaf — a
// GLOBAL resource held to one capture at a time by a module-scoped serializer
// — and a second serializer in a second plugin would race the first over the
// one leaf. That argument does not block THIS extraction: bases OWNS the leaf
// and the serializer, and `base_query`'s own handler was the only production
// caller left once triage was gone. So the whole set moved and NOTHING was
// copied — the mirror-image risk (a host copy racing the satellite's) is
// exactly why it had to be a move.
//
// ── the jd-scaffold module manifest USED TO LIVE HERE ──────────────────────
//
// Removed at the MUTATING-tier satellite extraction. Johnny Decimal scaffolding
// is now `packages/jd-scaffold` (id `vaultmcp-jd-scaffold`), publishing
// `vaultmcp_jd_scaffold_standard_zeros` / `_ensure_category_indexes` /
// `_promote_to_folder` / `_reindex_category` / `_new_standard_zero` /
// `_new_generic_id` / `_new_stem`.
//
// Its seven names are the one rename in the whole split that was FORCED rather
// than chosen: `external-tools.ts` refuses a published tool name beginning
// `obsidian_`, so no plugin id could have reproduced the `obsidian_jd_*`
// spellings. It declared NO config block, so unlike provenance and fileclass
// that plugin has nothing to adopt, and says so rather than shipping an empty
// migration.
//
// Two of its tools named a `path` argument; both are now `note_path`, which
// THIS host recognizes as a path key since round 1 (2026-09-07). So under an
// allowlist those two are scoped per-path and the kernel's record guard, lock
// consult and journal target all see the note they rewrite; the other five name
// no note and F3 refuses them wholesale. Two residuals are documented rather
// than glossed, both in `packages/jd-scaffold`: promote-to-folder writes to
// destinations the plan COMPUTES and no argument names (the obsidian_repoint_link
// boundary — reported back as `filesChanged`/`files` so the journal's `effects`
// names them), and reindex READS every sibling index file vault-wide at the area
// and system tiers, which the argument-derived guard cannot scope. The module
// bounded both itself with `visiblePaths`; a satellite cannot, and the reindex
// case was ratified as an accepted residual rather than closed.
//

/** The built-in capability modules, adapted without touching their tool

 *
 * Scheme's `ctxOf` closure deliberately ignores the `host`/`config`
 * parameters and builds from `deps` instead: it PRE-DATES the host, so its
 * config rows live in the top-level `schemes` setting (not
 * `modules.<id>.config`) and its tool layer filters via its own `getSettings`
 * + guard imports (not `host.visible`) — preserved verbatim so the mount is a
 * pure re-wiring, zero behavior change. Vocab was the other module in that
 * pair, on the top-level `vocabularies` setting, until it left for the
 * `vaultmcp-vocab` satellite at S7. A NEW module should do the opposite: read
 * `host`/`config` and use `host.visible`, per the adapters doc. */

    // tools ship as `packages/vocab` (plugin id `vaultmcp-vocab`), published
    // through vault-mcp-api as `vaultmcp_vocab_*`. Its kernel did NOT go with it
    // — it went to `@vault-mcp/core`, because the host's conformance rail is
    // its second consumer; the setting `settings.vocabularies` stays declared
    // host-side as the satellite's MIGRATION-ONLY adoption source, read by
    // nothing in the host (conformance builds from DEFAULT_VOCABULARIES and
    // always did). See the note where the manifest used to be.
    //
    // THE SKILLS MODULE IS GONE FROM HERE (suite split, S4). It was the FIRST
    // mutating capability module and it is the precedent several comments below
    // still cite; it now ships as its own plugin, `packages/skills` (plugin id
    // `vaultmcp-skills`), publishing the same six `vaultmcp_skills_*` tools through
    // vault-mcp-api like any third-party publisher. Its config left with it —
    // a stale `modules.skills` row in an existing data.json is simply an
    // unknown module id now, and the satellite adopts a copy of
    // `modules.skills.config` once, on its own first load, without writing
    // anything here.
    //
    // THE PROVENANCE MODULE IS GONE FROM HERE (mutating tier). Derived-content
    // freshness ships as `packages/provenance` (plugin id `vaultmcp-provenance`),
    // publishing `vaultmcp_provenance_check` / `_reconcile` / `_regen`. It took
    // its whole kernel (`src/kernel/provenance/`) with it — nothing else in
    // this plugin imported it — and its config left with it, so a stale
    // `modules.provenance` row in an existing data.json is simply an unknown
    // module id now.
    //
    // THE HEALTH MODULE IS GONE FROM HERE (suite split, S7). The tiered vault
    // health scan ships as `packages/health` (plugin id `vaultmcp-health`),
    // publishing `vaultmcp_health_scan` and `vaultmcp_health_lint`. It took its
    // whole kernel (`src/kernel/health/`) with it — nothing else in this
    // plugin imported it.
    //
    // THE FILECLASS MODULE IS GONE FROM HERE (mutating tier). The fileclass
    // CLI proxy ships as `packages/fileclass` (plugin id `vaultmcp-fileclass`),
    // publishing eight `vaultmcp_fileclass_*` tools. It had no kernel to take —
    // the engine is the CLI's — and its `binaryPath` config left with it. Its
    // double gate (Fileclass plugin loaded AND CLI binary found) went too, and
    // is now evaluated at publish time rather than per connection build.
    //
    // THE ACCEPTANCE MODULE IS GONE FROM HERE (host/provider split, S3c). The
    // human-only review pane ships as `packages/governor` (plugin id
    // `governor`), which owns its own enabled flag, its own config block and
    // its own settings tab. It contributed ZERO MCP tools while it lived here,
    // so nothing on the transport changed when it left — what changed is that
    // the host no longer holds a settings row for a pane it cannot mount.
    //
    // THE BASES MODULE IS GONE FROM HERE (suite split, S7). Evaluated Base
    // rows ship as `packages/bases` (plugin id `vaultmcp-bases`), publishing
    // `vaultmcp_bases_list` and `vaultmcp_bases_query`. The hidden-leaf capture
    // seam and its module-scoped serializer moved WITH it, as one piece and
    // with no copy left behind — see the note where the manifest used to be.
    //
    // THE JD-SCAFFOLD MODULE IS GONE FROM HERE (mutating tier). Johnny Decimal
    // scaffolding ships as `packages/jd-scaffold` (plugin id
    // `vaultmcp-jd-scaffold`), publishing seven `vaultmcp_jd_scaffold_*` tools. It
    // took its whole kernel (`src/kernel/jd-scaffold/`) and its Obsidian
    // adapter with it, and it declared no config at all, so there is not even a
    // stale settings row to leave behind.

 * fail this mount loudly and re-earn it through review, not drift in.
 * Refusals land in `problems` (and the tool is not registered) — the

 * Returns the registry so the caller (settings UI, diagnostics) can read
