 * A parsed address in the scheme's grammar.

 * token an address would carry at each level of nesting — not the grammar's
 * parsed structural fields (area/category/decimal), which a scheme need not
 * expose at all. It is what `expectedFolder` walks to place a note and what
 * `chainOf` walks in reverse. For Johnny Decimal (default config:
 * expandedAreas ["90-99"], expandedCategories ["27"]):
 *
 *   "00-09"    (area)                        -> ["00-09"]
 *   "06"       (category)                    -> ["00-09", "06"]
 *   "06.11"    (id)                          -> ["00-09", "06", "11"]
 *   "06.110"   (id, 3-digit decimal)         -> ["00-09", "06", "110"]
 *   "92021"    (expanded-item, area 90-99
 *               is itself expanded)          -> ["90-99", "92021"]
 *              — no category folder: an expanded AREA collapses the
 *                category level entirely, items sit directly under the area.
 *   "92021.10" (fractal-id, inside an
 *               expanded area)               -> ["90-99", "92021", "10"]
 *   "27001"    (expanded-item, category 27
 *               is itself expanded)          -> ["20-29", "27", "27001"]
 *              — the category folder SURVIVES: only category 27 flattens to
 *                5-digit ids, the area around it is ordinary.
 *
 * `raw` carries the exact (trimmed) input string `parse` accepted; `format`
 * is defined in terms of it.
