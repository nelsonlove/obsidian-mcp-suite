// tools.ts — the vault-vocab satellite's tool surface: the controlled
// vocabulary's READ surface, four tools published to the Governor host through
// `vault-mcp-api` (see main.ts):
//
//   vocabularies    — enumerate the configured vocabulary sources
//   resolve_term    — token → entry; path → that note's own terms; parse mode
//   validate_terms  — one note's frontmatter → findings
//   list_vocabulary — the registered entries of one kind, optionally scoped
//
// The vocab counterpart of the host's scope tools: where the scope provider
// answers "where does this note live", this answers "is this tag / property /
// type / term a registered one, and what does it mean". Validation and
// resolution only — nothing here mutates a note, and the whole-vault rule pack
// (`noteVocabFindings`'s vault-wide sibling in core) is deliberately NOT
// published: capabilities arrive as rule packs, never as new surface.
//
// ── THE KERNEL IS IN CORE, AND THAT IS THE HEADLINE DECISION ────────────────
//
// Everything vocabulary — the providers, the registry, the findings, the
// entry/finding types — is imported from `@vault-mcp/core`. There is NO
// `src/kernel/` in this package, deliberately, and adding one would be a bug.
// The kernel has TWO consumers and always did: these four tools, and the HOST's
// conformance rail (`conformance/packs/vocab.ts` wraps `noteVocabFindings`,
// `conformance/cli.ts` builds a `VocabRegistry` per run, and `conformance/
// snapshot.ts` / `rule-pack.ts` are typed over `VocabNote`).
//
// Be precise about what that dependency is and is NOT. The rail needs the
// KERNEL, but it builds its registry from `DEFAULT_VOCABULARIES`: all three
// `runConformance` call sites — `mcp/obsidian-drift-source.ts`,
// `mcp/obsidian-debt-source.ts` and `conformance/cli.ts`'s CLI entry — pass the
// shipped defaults unconditionally, and none has ever read the user's
// configured list. So the kernel's second CONSUMER is real (which is why the
// kernel is in core), while a second reader of the SETTING is not (which is why
// this plugin owns `vocabularies` outright — see settings.ts).
//
// Two copies of a rule core is how one vault gets two
// vocabularies, so publishing into core was the only non-forking answer — the
// `isVisible` (S4) and `executeQuickAddChoice` (S5) precedent, and the same
// reasoning that keeps `visiblePaths` here a three-line local wrapper over
// core's published `isVisible` rather than a second copy of the predicate.
//
// ── The published names CHANGED, and the `obsidian_` prefix went with them ──
//
// The host publishes an external tool as `<sanitized publisher id>_<bare name>`
// (`sanitizeOwnerId`). This plugin's id is `vault-vocab`, which sanitizes to
// `vault_vocab`, so the four bare names below go on the wire as
// `vault_vocab_vocabularies` / `_resolve_term` / `_validate_terms` /
// `_list_vocabulary`. The shipped module spelled them `obsidian_vocabularies`
// and friends; the `obsidian_` prefix was the HOST's built-in namespace, not
// this module's name, so keeping it would have published
// `vault_vocab_obsidian_vocabularies` — a name that says the module twice and
// the namespace not at all. Stripping it is a CHOICE, not a forced move: the
// host's F1 check (`external-tools.ts`) tests the PUBLISHED name for an
// `obsidian_` prefix, and `vault_vocab_obsidian_vocabularies` does not start
// with `obsidian_`, so it would have registered. See CLAUDE.md for the rename
// table and the one-line reversal.
//
// ── Allowlist discipline, as a satellite ────────────────────────────────────
//
// The ENFORCED boundary is now the HOST's, and — unlike every prior satellite —
// this surface is NOT uniform. The host's F3 gate is evaluated at CALL TIME on
// the ACTUAL ARGUMENTS (`settings.allowlist.length > 0 && collectPaths(args)
// .length === 0`), not on the declared schema, so:
//
//   * `vocabularies` takes no arguments at all ⇒ BLOCKED outright under an
//     active allowlist.
//   * `list_vocabulary` takes `kind` / `scope` / `vocabulary`, none of them a
//     host path key ⇒ BLOCKED outright under an active allowlist.
//   * `validate_terms` REQUIRES `path`, which IS a host path key ⇒ never
//     blocked by F3; the host scopes it and refuses `out_of_allowlist` for a
//     hidden note.
//   * `resolve_term`'s `path` is OPTIONAL, so the SAME TOOL is blocked when
//     called as `{token: "note/task"}` and scoped when called as
//     `{path: "Notes/x.md"}`. That per-call asymmetry is the single most
//     surprising fact about this extraction and it is pinned by test.
//
// All four declare `readOnly: true`, which the host DISTRUSTS unless
// `vault-vocab` appears in the user's `trustedReadOnlyPlugins` setting.
// Untrusted ⇒ all four register as MUTATING ⇒ read-only mode blocks all four,
// and each takes a write-queue slot and a journal record. Trust restores
// read-only-mode availability but does NOT change F3 (trust answers read-only
// mode, never scoping — closed 2026-09-05 by the skills satellite's review).
//
// ── WHAT THE DORMANT SEAM COSTS, STATED HONESTLY ────────────────────────────
//
// `ctx.visible` / `ctx.getSettings` are kept as seams and are NOT supplied in
// the shipped configuration, exactly like the triage and crosssession
// satellites'. For those two packages that cost nothing enforceable, because
// the host blocks their whole surface under an allowlist. Here it costs
// something real and it must not be papered over:
//
//   * As a MODULE, `buildListing` ran `visible(source.paths())` before any body
//     was read, so a registry note outside the caller's allowlist never entered
//     the providers at all — no entry, no count, no example, no candidate.
//   * As a SATELLITE, nothing supplies `visible`, so the providers are built
//     from the WHOLE vault listing on every call. For the two tools the host
//     blocks outright that is unreachable and therefore harmless. For the two
//     it lets through it is reachable: the host scopes the `path` ARGUMENT, but
//     the vocabulary the answer is computed against is not the argument and is
//     named by no argument — the same "discovered target" shape as
//     `vault_crosssession_post`'s log file.
//
// What that discloses to a session under an allowlist, precisely (it is
// narrower than a body read, and wider than nothing):
//
//   * `validate_terms` on a VISIBLE note: for each token that note already
//     carries, whether a possibly-hidden registry declares it, whether it is
//     retired, and — through the `ambiguous` finding's detail, which names
//     `VocabAmbiguousError.candidates` — the PATHS of the registry notes that
//     claim a duplicated token. That last one is a genuine path oracle.
//   * `resolve_term` with `path` on a VISIBLE note: for each token that note
//     already carries, its canonical form, its declaring vocabulary id and its
//     `definition` gloss, which is frontmatter text lifted from a registry note
//     that may itself be hidden. Path-mode never emits candidate paths (it
//     catches `VocabAmbiguousError` and reports a bare `ambiguous: true`).
//
// Both are bounded by the tokens the caller's own visible note carries — a
// session cannot ask "what else is in the hidden registry", only "is this
// token, which I can already read, registered somewhere". It is still a
// LOOSENING relative to the folded module, and it is the one direction in which
// this extraction is not strictly stricter. The fix is not available from
// inside a satellite: a published tool cannot consult the host's allowlist, and
// that is precisely the boundary the split exists to draw. It becomes fixable
// the day `vault-mcp-api` can carry the caller's scope to a publisher
// (apiVersion 2) — at which point `ctx.visible` goes live with no code change
// here, which is exactly why the seam is kept and why the tests supply it.
//
// ── Envelope convention (the satellite contract) ────────────────────────────
//
// A handler returns PLAIN DATA and THROWS on refusal. The host wraps a return
// value in `ok()` and a thrown error in `fail()`; `fail()` reads a
// lowercase-snake `code` off the thrown error and renders `Error [code]:
// message`. `ok` / `fail` / `codedError` themselves are host-internal and are
// NOT imported here. `vocab_ambiguous` and `out_of_allowlist` keep their exact
// codes and messages; the two argument-shape errors in `resolve_term` GAINED a
// code (they used to render codeless as `Error: give \`token\` or \`path\`…`),
// which is a deliberate improvement recorded in CLAUDE.md's envelope table.
//
// ── Schema fidelity across the boundary ─────────────────────────────────────
//
// The SDK converts a zod shape to JSON Schema and the host converts it back
// through a deliberately small subset (`json-schema-to-zod.ts`): `type`,
// `description`, STRING `enum` and the object's `required` list survive;
// `default`, `min`, `max` and `pattern` DO NOT. So every `.min(1)` below is
// re-applied in the handler (`requireText`) — the `vault_skills_release` semver
// lesson. `kind`'s enum and `list_vocabulary`'s requirement of it do survive,
// and are re-checked anyway because both handlers branch on the value.
//
// Obsidian-free by construction: vault state arrives through the injected
// VocabSource (structurally typed, like LinkSource), so every handler is
// unit-testable headlessly. The live adapter is in obsidian-source.ts.
