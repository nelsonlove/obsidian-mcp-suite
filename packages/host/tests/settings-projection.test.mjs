/**
 * settings-projection.test.mjs — every setting reaches the server, or is
 * deliberately withheld.
 *
 * The bug this exists to prevent, found by review rather than by a test:
 *
 *   `main.ts` declares `captureObservations` and `captureMaxBytes`, the
 *   settings UI writes them, `main.ts` sanitizes them on load — and
 *   `ctx.getSettings()` did not pass them on. `server.ts` read
 *   `ctx.getSettings().captureObservations`, got `undefined`, and the toggle
 *   did nothing at all. No test failed. The typechecker said nothing, because
 *   `ServerCtx`'s new fields are declared optional — so an omission is a
 *   legal program, and the feature was inert in production while every unit
 *   test passed against hand-built fixtures.
 *
 * That is a general hazard, not a one-off: `getSettings()` is a hand-written
 * object literal, and a hand-written projection of a growing interface drifts
 * from it silently and permanently. So this scans the source and requires that
 * every declared setting is either forwarded or listed below as withheld ON
 * PURPOSE, with the reason written down.
 *
 * DENY BY DEFAULT: a new setting fails this test until somebody decides which
 * of the two it is. That is the point — the decision is cheap when you are
 * adding the field and expensive six months later when a feature turns out to
 * have never worked.
