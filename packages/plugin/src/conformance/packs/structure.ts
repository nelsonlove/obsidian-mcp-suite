// packs/structure.ts — the structure rule pack: a verbatim TypeScript port of
// conformance_check.py, the blueprint-conformance guard.
//
// The Blueprint plugin owns a note's body structure. On apply, a heading the
// blueprint does not emit is not emitted at all — its content is gone. This
// pack derives each blueprint's emitted H2 set from its source (literal `## `
// lines, `{# #}` comments removed, one level of `{% include %}` resolved,
// `___REST___` fork sections stripped) and compares it to the H2 set of every
// note whose `blueprint:` frontmatter names it.
//
// Findings the ratchet keys (conformance_ratchet.py's `parse_conformance`):
//   - DROPPED — the note carries an H2 its blueprint does not emit; an apply
//     deletes that section. Key ("conformance_check","DROPPED",<path>,<bp base>).
//   - NO-BLUEPRINT — the note names a blueprint file that does not exist. Key
//     ("conformance_check","NO-BLUEPRINT",<path>,<full wikilink inner>).
//   - UNRESOLVED-INCLUDE (#112c, TS-native — no Python counterpart) — a
//     governed blueprint's `{% include %}` names a target absent from the
//     blueprint listing. The Python read include targets straight off disk;
//     the TS resolves them against the snapshot's blueprint set and used to
//     no-op silently on a miss, so `emittedH2s` returned a SMALLER emitted set
//     than the blueprint declares and every note checked against it was linted
//     against incomplete headings — a silent false negative, measured live in
//     the governed tree (a `ScopeNoteHeader.blueprint` include beginning with
//     a literal `…` placeholder). Same absence-vs-emptiness class as
//     #125/#133/#136. Reported as a finding — never a throw (one bad include
//     must not kill the pack's whole run) — the rail's idiom: detect, humans
//     fix. Key ("conformance_check","UNRESOLVED-INCLUDE",<bp path>,<target>).
// REFILL (blueprint emits an H2 the note lacks — a warning) and SKIPPED (a
// dynamic-H2 blueprint that cannot be checked statically) are NOT findings, so
// the pack emits neither, exactly as the ratchet parser dropped them. The pack
// id IS the `script` field: "conformance_check".
