// The ONE agent-expressible disposition: `governance_submit_revision` (#101, phase 1 of #221).
//
// A revising agent — one whose note a human sent back with `acceptance-status: revising` and a
// `[!revision-request]` callout in the note BODY — resubmits its work: the status returns to
// `proposed`, the addressed `[!revision-request]` callout(s) are removed, and (when a `summary`
// is given) a `[!revision-report]` callout is inserted below the H1 for the reviewer to read and
// dispose of at review. The write lands in the pending channel like any other agent write: the
// kernel journals it, so the governance pane surfaces the note for human review.
//
// AUTHORITY (the #221 axis): this verb supplies a CANDIDATE; it decides nothing. It is declared
// as the single `authority: "agent"` descriptor in governor/kernel/dispositions.ts, and it is
// an ORDINARY GUARDED MUTATING TOOL — registered through the patched registrar in server.ts
// (`readOnlyHint: false`), so read-only mode, the path allowlist, the write queue, the write
// journal and the kernel args (`if_rev` / `idempotency_key` / `intent`) all bind at the standard
// interception point. Nothing here is pane machinery, and nothing in the pane can be reached
// from here.
//
// IT CAN NEVER WRITE ACCEPTANCE. Three independent layers make that true:
//   1. The only status value in this module is the literal `proposed`, written by
//      `setAcceptanceStatusProposed` (governor/kernel/revision.ts), which takes no value
//      parameter — there is no argument through which an accepted-family value could arrive.
//   2. The reviewer text/summary lands as `> `-quoted callout lines in the BODY, behind the
//      frontmatter fence recognized by the shared core recognizer — quoted lines cannot form a
//      frontmatter fence, so a hostile summary cannot smuggle an acceptance assertion into
//      properties.
//   3. Belt-and-suspenders: before writing, the (before, after) frontmatter transition is
//      re-checked with the SHARED accept guard (`acceptTransitionReason`, @vault-mcp/core — the
//      one definition of "asserts acceptance"); any accepted-family introduction/change refuses
//      with `Error [accept_forbidden]` and writes nothing.
//
// Obsidian-free by construction (the tools-pending-review.ts discipline): everything arrives
// through the injected `RevisionSource`, so the whole handler is headless-testable; only the
// adapter in server.ts touches `app`.
