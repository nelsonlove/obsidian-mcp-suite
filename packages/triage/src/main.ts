// VAULT TRIAGE — inbox triage as its own Obsidian plugin.
//
// The disposition substrate's second instance (#221, phase-3 shape per #241),
// published to the Governor host through vault-mcp-api as two MCP tools:
//
//   vault_triage_queue    — the agent's view of a triage queue (read-only in
//                           intent; the host distrusts that claim, see below);
//   vault_triage_dispose  — the one guarded mutating verb, dry-run by default.
//
// SATELLITE OF THE SUITE (suite-split design §6: "Triage | private operator |
// satellite"). Extracted out of the host at S5, following the
// quickadd-choices-compile pilot and the vault-skills satellite. Consequences
// of the publishing contract, each deliberate:
//
//   * THE PUBLISHED TOOL NAMES CHANGED — `triage_queue` / `triage_dispose`
//     became `vault_triage_queue` / `vault_triage_dispose`. The host publishes
//     an external tool as `<sanitized publisher id>_<bare name>`, so the plugin
//     id IS the tool namespace; `vault-triage` sanitizes to `vault_triage`.
//     This is the extraction's one breaking change and it is recorded in
//     CLAUDE.md, not buried here.
//   * THE ALLOWLIST BOUNDARY MOVED TO THE HOST. An external tool's
//     `readOnlyHint: true` is a claim the host distrusts unless the raw
//     publisher id is in its `trustedReadOnlyPlugins` list, so BOTH tools
//     register as mutating; and a mutating external tool whose arguments carry
//     no recognized path key is blocked outright while a path allowlist is
//     active. `queue` carries none, so under an allowlist it is refused
//     wholesale. `dispose` carries `path` — and, since this extraction,
//     `target_path` rather than `target`, so the host's guard checks the
//     destination folder the caller names. See the long note in tools.ts.
//   * REFUSALS THROW; the host renders a thrown error's lowercase-snake `code`
//     as `Error [code]: message`, the envelope the module already produced.
//   * The host's queue, journal and kernel args still apply — external mutating
//     tools ride the guarded registration path like every built-in.
//
// THIS PLUGIN NEEDS THE HOST, which is the opposite of the skills satellite.
// Triage has no pane, no palette command and no ribbon: its entire surface is
// the two published tools. With Governor absent it loads, keeps its settings,
// adopts nothing, and does nothing — `publishTools` waits on the host's ready
// event and registers if one appears. The settings tab says so plainly.
//
// RE-PUBLISHING ON CONFIG CHANGE is the one structural difference from the
// skills satellite, and it is not decoration. `vault_triage_dispose`'s
// `disposition` argument is a zod ENUM over the merged (built-in ∪ declared)
// table, and its description renders one line per verb — both computed from
// config. As a host module the specs were rebuilt per CONNECTION, so a declared
// row added in settings appeared on the next agent connect. A published spec is
// snapshotted by the host when it is registered, so without this the enum would
// freeze at plugin load and a newly declared row would be unreachable through
// the schema. Disposing and re-publishing on every settings write restores that
// freshness at a finer granularity than before.
