// packs/ste.ts — the STE rule pack: a verbatim TypeScript port of ste_lint.py,
// the Simplified Technical English (ASD-STE100) mechanical-subset lint over
// authored prose.
//
// It checks the mechanical rules a regex can decide — no semicolons, no banned
// modals (should/would/may/might/could), no contractions, no present perfect
// (has/have/had been) — over PROSE ONLY: frontmatter, fenced code, inline code,
// wikilink targets, and double-quoted spans are stripped first (prose_lines).
//
// Finding key (the frozen ratchet normalization from conformance_ratchet.py's
// `parse_ste`, fed by `ste_lint --editable-violations`): a per-violation line
// `<path>:<lineno>: <name> '<token>' — <ctx>` becomes
//   ("ste_lint", "editable", <path>, "<name> '<token.toLowerCase()>'").
// The token is LOWER-CASED in the key (a case flip would/Would must not churn),
// line number + context are excluded, and ONLY editable-classified notes are
// keyed — band01 (reviewer-owned architecture prose) and frozen (.04 records)
// are excluded, exactly as `--editable-violations` did. The pack id IS the
// `script` field: "ste_lint".

 * becomes the token half of the key. MODAL / PERFECT are case-insensitive;
 * CONTRACTION is case-SENSITIVE (as in the Python); SEMI is a bare `;`.
 *
 * PINNED (#112a): `\b`/`\w` here are JS's ASCII-only classes, where Python's
 * `re` (which ste_lint.py used) treated `\w` as Unicode — so a token glued to
 * a NON-ASCII letter ("shouldé") matches here where the Python did not. The
 * Python rail is retired, so these ASCII semantics ARE the rail's own now,
 * kept deliberately: switching to Unicode-aware boundaries (`\b` has no `u`-
 * aware form; it would need a rewrite) changes what the lint reports and
 * re-keys findings, which is a human behavior decision, not a port fix.
 * Pinned by "ASCII word boundaries are the rail's own semantics" in
 * tests/conformance-legacy-packs.test.mjs. */

 * frontmatter skipped, fenced code skipped, inline code + wikilink aliases +
 * double-quoted spans stripped. `text` is universal-newline-normalized.
 *
 * The frontmatter skip binds to core's shared recognizer (`stripLeadingBom` +
 * `stripLeadingFrontmatter`, #189/#223) — NOT the Python's literal
 * `lines[0] === "---"` scan this ported. That scan was BOM-blind (a BOM'd
 * note's frontmatter was linted as prose, #227), kept at port time only for
 * byte-parity with the Python rail; the rail is retired, so parity is
 * historical and the recognizer is the vault's own. Consequence, noted
 * honestly: a note whose fence only the shared recognizer sees (leading BOM,
 * trailing whitespace on the opener, a `----`-style closer) now has its
 * frontmatter exempted, so its ste finding keys can shift (typically:
 * frontmatter-only hits disappear) — those re-bless at the next human
 * rebaseline. Keys for notes with an ordinary exact-`---` fence, and for
 * notes with no (or unterminated) frontmatter, are byte-stable (pinned in
