/**
 * scheme-addressing.test.mjs — Task 7 of the scope-provider module:
 * `jd:<address>` universal addressing at the guard interception point.
 *
 * The uid-addressing analog (tests/uid-index.test.mjs's "uid references" and
 * "uid addressing through the guarded wrapper" sections) is the precedent
 * this mirrors — same shape, same properties, same disclosure guarantees:
 *
 *   • resolveSchemeArgs   — `<scheme-id>:<address>` rewriting at the guarded
 *                           wrapper, defined over the guard's own path walker
 *   • makeGuarded         — the interception point: uid resolution runs
 *                           first, scheme resolution second, both before
 *                           guardCall, both refusing before the handler runs
