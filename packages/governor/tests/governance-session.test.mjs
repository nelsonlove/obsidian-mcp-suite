/**
 * governance-session.test.mjs — WP5 sessions, as the PROVIDER still owns them
 * after S3c.
 *
 * ── WHAT THE SPLIT TOOK, AND WHERE IT WENT ──────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Condition 7 says THE HOST MINTS. `openSession` is host code
 * (`packages/host/src/kernel/sessions/session.ts`), the lifecycle record is the
 * host's `sessions.jsonl` written by `createSessionLog`, and NO connection-
 * lifecycle hook was added to the seam — deliberately, because a provider that
 * never mints does not need one. So three describes that used to live here are
 * gone rather than reimplemented:
 *
 *   • the MINTING contract (a UUIDv7 id bound to vault/replica/actor/base
 *     state/scope, `expiresAt === openedAt + SESSION_TTL_MS`, no mandate at
 *     open, a continuation link that inherits nothing) — host's `openSession`.
 *     **NOT COVERED ANYWHERE as of 2026-09-08**: `packages/host/tests/
 *     seam.test.mjs` only CALLS `openSession` to build fixtures for
 *     `expiryRefusal`, and `packages/core/tests/` carries no session test at
 *     all. Named as a gap rather than dropped quietly; it cannot be written
 *     here, because importing `openSession` would be a cross-package reach into
 *     the host's tree.
 *   • the DEQUEUE check, behaviourally — a mutating call whose session refusal
 *     fires refuses with the coded error and the handler never runs, `null` is
 *     silence, an unknown code renders verbatim, and no refusal hook means no
 *     check. That is `makeGuarded`'s `sessionRefusal` option, host code. **ALSO
 *     NOT COVERED**: host `seam.test.mjs` proves `createGovernanceSeam`'s
 *     `refuseSession` in isolation (deny-wins, throwing-hook-fails-closed,
 *     null-is-silence) but nothing passes `sessionRefusal` into `makeGuarded`,
 *     so the composition — the thing that makes a revocation actually stop a
 *     write — is asserted nowhere.
 *   • the SOURCE PINS over `src/mcp/server.ts` (`openSession(`, the executor's
 *     session id, the journal actor, `expiryRefusal(session, now)`,
 *     `ctx.seam?.refuseSession(`, the absence of `ctx.sessions.get(`). That file
 *     belongs to another package; a scan reaching across the boundary would pin
 *     a claim this plugin does not own. Dropped. What guards those facts now is
 *     the host's own suite, which does not yet pin them either.
 *
 * ── WHAT STAYS, BECAUSE IT IS THIS PLUGIN'S ─────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The durable STORE and the revocation state a human's Revoke gesture writes.
 * Plus, new at S3c, the ID-KEYED AUTHORITY FOLD: because the provider no longer
 * witnesses session OPEN, `revoke` and `attachMandate` must work on an id with
 * no `opened` record, `revocationRefusal(id)` answers the seam, and
 * `mandateOf(id)` serves the write observer. `foldSessionEvents` is UNCHANGED
 * and still refuses to invent a session — every historical line in a live
 * `governance/sessions.jsonl` folds exactly as before, which is asserted below.
 *
 * The pure transitions (`closeSession` / `revokeSession` / `expireSession` /
 * `attachMandate` / `SessionNotLiveError`) are `@vault-mcp/core`'s, not this
 * plugin's. They are exercised here anyway, deliberately: the fold is DEFINED
 * over them, core ships no session test, and a contract that only its consumer
 * tests is better than one nothing tests. If core grows its own suite these move
 * there.
