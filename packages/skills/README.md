# Vault Skills (plugin id `vault-skills`)

Compiles the vault's skill / agent / policy / command notes into a Claude Code plugin and materializes it to disk. Two surfaces over one compiler core: an in-Obsidian human surface (a preview pane, six palette commands, a ribbon icon, opt-in export-on-save) and an agent-facing surface of six MCP tools published to the Governor host.

The user-facing deep reference — the flat output model, the multi-valued `parent:` edge, `preload:` semantics, `no-skills:` — is `docs/skills.md` at the repo root. This file is about the plugin: what is in the package, how it relates to the host, and the two things the extraction changed.

## Lineage

Written as the standalone `obsidian-vault-skills` plugin, folded into the Governor host as a capability module (`modules.skills`, issue #82), and extracted back out to its own plugin at the suite split's S4 — the design doc's `docs/suite-split-design.md` §6 row *"Skills compiler | private operator | satellite — the biggest single extraction; least entangled"*. It follows `packages/quickadd-choices-compile`, the pilot satellite. The compiler code is the same code through all three homes; only who mounts it differs.

Installed into a vault this is three files — `main.js`, `manifest.json`, and (during development) a `.hotreload` marker file in the installed plugin directory so the hot-reload plugin picks up rebuilds. The `.hotreload` file lives in the vault install, never in this repo.

## Build and test

```bash
npm run build          # esbuild → main.js
npm test               # tsc --noEmit && node --test 'tests/*.test.mjs'
```

`pretest` rebuilds `@vault-mcp/core` first, for the same reason the host's does: several tests import published core contracts from `packages/core/dist`, so without the rebuild you are testing the previous build's bytes.

## It works with no host installed

The pane, the commands, the ribbon, and export-on-save are pure Obsidian plus the compiler core. With Governor absent all of that still works; only the six MCP tools go unpublished, and they appear on their own the moment a host loads (the SDK registers on the host's ready event). `main.ts` registers the human surface before it publishes, so the claim and the code agree.

## The two things the extraction changed

### 1. The allowlist boundary moved to the host — and got stricter

While skills was a module, `vault_skills_preview` filtered the compiled BODIES it returned by each contributing note's visibility under the host's path allowlist. That filter is still in `src/tools.ts`, in full, and nothing was deleted from it — but it is **defence in depth now, not the enforced boundary**, and in the shipped configuration it does nothing at all: a satellite cannot reach the host's guard settings, so `ctx.getSettings` is undefined and the filter degrades through exactly the `!settings ||` branch it always had.

The enforced boundary is the host's external-tool gate, and it refuses more than the filter ever did:

- An external tool's `readOnlyHint: true` is a CLAIM the host distrusts unless the publisher's raw plugin id appears in the host's `trustedReadOnlyPlugins` setting. Untrusted, all six of these register as **mutating**.
- A mutating external tool whose arguments carry **no recognized path key** is **blocked outright** while a path allowlist is active — it cannot be scoped, so it is refused rather than guessed at.

Five of the six tools (`validate`, `tree`, `preview`, `export`, `release`) carry no path argument. So under an active allowlist they are refused **wholesale**, where the module version merely filtered `preview`'s bodies. That is fail-closed and it is strictly stricter than before. `vault_skills_mark` carries `path`, so it is scoped normally by the guard, and it still runs the accept-forbidden guard before any write.

The in-satellite filter is kept because the expensive part of it is correct and hard-won: a compiled body is ASSEMBLED from up to three notes — the entry's own source, everything it transcludes, and every `type: policy` note injected into an agent — and an independent review found the first version of the fix checking only the first of those. That reasoning becomes live again the moment `vault-mcp-api` can carry the caller's scope to a publisher, which is an apiVersion-2 item. Its tests supply `getSettings` themselves so the dormant guard stays honest.

### 2. Settings adopt once from the host, and never write back

Configuration used to live in the host's `data.json` at `modules.skills.config`. On first load this plugin copies the recognized keys into its own `data.json` and latches:

- **It never writes the host's settings** — not to delete the adopted keys, not to mark them migrated. The host's copy stays where it is and simply stops being read.
- **It runs once.** A later host edit cannot reach back in.
- **This plugin's own values win.** Adoption only fills gaps.
- **If the host is absent, nothing is adopted and the latch is not set** — so the one chance survives to a later load, and standalone installs are unaffected.

See `src/settings.ts`; the rules are pinned by `tests/skills-module.test.mjs`.

## The tool names did not change

Each spec in `src/tools.ts` carries a bare name (`validate`, `tree`, `preview`, `export`, `release`, `mark`). The host publishes an external tool as `<sanitized publisher id>_<bare name>`, and `vault-skills` sanitizes to `vault_skills` — so the wire names are still exactly `vault_skills_validate` … `vault_skills_mark`. That is deliberate: renaming shipped tool names breaks agent sessions for zero semantic gain, which is the host's own locked-decision precedent for `governance_revisions` / `governance_submit_revision`.

## What the host still owns

Everything a published tool rides through: the guarded registration point, read-only mode, the path allowlist, the serialized write queue, the write journal, `if_rev` / `idempotency_key` / `intent`, advisory locks, and record immutability. Publishing does not exempt a tool from any of it. What the satellite owns is the compiler, the human surface, its own settings, and the accept-forbidden guard on `mark` — which runs `acceptTransitionReason` from `@vault-mcp/core`, a published contract, so leaving the host did not leave the guard behind.
