// GOVERNOR — the governance provider, as its own Obsidian plugin.
//
// Everything that decides authority: proposals, verification, admission,
// cohorts, mandates, transformations and promotion, the Git-backed history
// store, the legacy acceptance machinery with its cutover and store binding,
// and the human-only review pane. It plugs into the Vault MCP host through the
// governance seam and publishes five MCP tools through `vault-mcp-api`.
//
// ── WHAT CROSSES THE SEAM, AND WHY EACH DIRECTION IS SAFE ───────────────────
//
// CANDIDATES flow OUTWARD: the host hands over the exact bytes of a completed
// write and this plugin turns them into a proposal. A proposal confers nothing —
// agents and machinery supply candidates, humans decide.
//
// REFUSALS flow INWARD: this plugin answers "refuse this session or not", and a
// refusal can only make the host refuse MORE. `null` is silence, not an allow;
// the type cannot express permission.
//
// Nothing else crosses. The host never asks this plugin for permission to write,
// never learns why a session was refused beyond the refusal's own detail string,
// and works completely with this plugin absent — every seam consultation on a
// provider-less host iterates an empty list.
//
// ── WHY THIS PLUGIN KEPT THE ID `governor` ──────────────────────────────────
//
// Because the authority state did not move. `.obsidian/plugins/governor/governance/`
// — baselines, the acceptance log, the pending index, proposals, mandates,
// sessions, the cutover marker — and `~/.claude/governor/history/<vault-slug>/`
// (the standing chain, and the store identity the marker names) are the
// operator's live evidence, and the safest migration for them was none. The HOST
// took the id `vault-mcp` back instead, and copies its journal, its install id
// and its own settings keys out of this folder once, without moving or deleting
// anything.
//
// ── WHAT THIS PLUGIN DOES NOT DO ────────────────────────────────────────────
//
// It does not open the socket, write the bridge, guard reads, run the write
// queue, or append to the write journal. All of that is the host's, and the
// journal in particular is the host's file in the host's directory — this plugin
// only READS it, to derive the review queue.

    // hooks — a stale observer holding a dead provider's stores is worse than no
    // observer, and after the split "dead" is a real state a human reaches with
    // one click in Obsidian's settings.
    // #261's DRIVE, re-established on this side of the split. Chromium
    // throttles and suspends renderer timers while the Obsidian window is
    // occluded, so the review queue's 2.5s poll simply does not tick during
    // unattended sessions — which is exactly when agents write. Before the
    // split the host solved that by nudging the queue from inside its
    // `journal.append` wrapper: a timer-free event that fires precisely when
    // there is new work.
    //
    // The host cannot do that any more, and no journal-growth hook was added to
    // the seam for it. The signal it uses instead is the one the seam ALREADY
    // carries: the write observer fires after the host's own journal append, for
    // every completed write, so nudging from there is the same event arriving
    // through an existing hook rather than a new one.

    // THE NARROWING, stated because it is real: the old nudge fired on EVERY
    // journal append, including ones that take no queue slot (idempotent
    // replays, deduped waiters, key mismatches) and mutating operations that
    // are not native note-writes. The observer fires only where the host
    // produced write facts. So an occluded window now sees the queue driven by
    // note-writes alone, and everything else waits for the poll. That covers
    // what the queue is for — proposals come from write facts, and the
