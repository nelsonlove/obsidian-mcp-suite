/**
 * conformance-snapshot.test.mjs — the headless vault reader.
 *
 * Walks a root, reads .md + .fileclass files, parses frontmatter (reusing
 * @vault-mcp/core's parseAllFrontmatter — no new dependency), and produces the
 * VaultSnapshot the packs consume. Vault-relative paths; excludedRoots honored
 * (the seam that keeps archaeology out of the rail, aligned with worker-3's B).
 *
 * `boundary: root` is passed on every legacy fixture call below because
 * buildSnapshot now refuses to walk without a declared boundary (#157) — see
 * the "territory guard" describe blocks at the bottom of this file for the
 * new coverage that motivated it.

 * Review finding on the first version of this guard: checking `root` alone
 * is not "unconditional" — it bounds what `root` may equal, not what the walk
 * may actually read. Two concrete gaps it left open, both closed here:
 *
 *   1. A symlinked FILE nested inside an otherwise-legitimate tree:
 *      `entry.isDirectory()` is false for a symlink regardless of its
 *      target, so it reaches Pass 1 untouched by the root-level check, and
 *      its REAL target is what `readFile` actually honors.
 *   2. A plainly-named denied directory nested several levels below `root`
 *      (no symlink at all) — Pass 2 previously recursed into it
 *      unconditionally.
