// kernel/survey/boundary.ts — containment check for a survey mirror
// directory, added in response to code review on this module's first cut.
//
// The first cut passed `mirror_root` (a caller-supplied argument) and a
// note's own `survey-mirror` frontmatter override straight to `fs.statSync`/
// `fs.readdirSync` with no check at all: neither is a vault path, so
// guard.ts's PATH_KEYS allowlist never sees either one, and there was
// nothing else guarding them. A note's `survey-mirror: ~/.ssh` would have
// made obsidian_survey_status enumerate it.
//
// This repo already solved the identical problem once, for
// conformance/snapshot.ts's caller-named `root` (issue #157, commit
// e4efe59) — three checks, in this order: the root's real path must be
// resolvable at all; it must not fall inside a permanently denied
// territory, UNCONDITIONALLY, even when explicitly requested; and it must
// resolve inside a boundary that is DECLARED, never defaulted. Reused here
// via the same pure `intendedRealPath`/`isInside` pair snapshot.ts uses (no
// second implementation of "is this path really inside that one" — a
// symlink is exactly what a second, naive implementation would miss), with
// survey's own deny-list (there is no reason a filesystem mirror should
// ever resolve into a dotfile-hidden directory or the OS's own private
// trees) rather than snapshot.ts's vault-specific one.

// Dotfile/dot-directory segments only — matches walk()'s own ignore rule, so
// a mirror root can't resolve through something the walk would then silently
// skip the contents of anyway. Deliberately NOT a broader OS-path deny-list

// broke on its own test fixtures: macOS resolves the real tmpdir through
// /private/var/..., so that list would have refused every temp-directory
// mirror root, not just genuine system trees). The boundary check below is
// what does the real work; this only closes the same dotfile gap walk()
// already closes for its own traversal.
