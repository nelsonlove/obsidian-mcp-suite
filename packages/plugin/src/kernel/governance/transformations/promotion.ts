// PROMOTION EVIDENCE — the gate between "eligible" and "automatic" (WP10;
// D02, D14; sessions-mandates-and-cohorts.md line 136).
//
// "Automatic admission is enabled only after the same transformation,
// verifier, and recovery path have passed the required live evidence gate."
// That sentence is this file. The TUPLE is exact — transformation id AND
// version, the canonical verifier set, the recovery unit — and evidence for
// any other tuple is evidence for nothing here: a new verifier version
// restarts the clock, which is the point of separately versioned verifiers.
//
// Evidence is FACTS, recorded automatically from real admissions and
// reverts; promotion is a HUMAN ACT on top of the facts — gesture-gated,
// like every other authority grant. The split matters: facts accumulate
// without anyone deciding anything, and the decision cannot be made where
// the facts are missing (`promote` refuses NAMING what is absent — an
// unmet gate must never render as an empty result; the week's recurring
// bug, designed out rather than tested out).
//
// Required evidence classes, per tuple, before promotion is even offerable:
//   * ≥1 individual-admit  — the pilot: a human admitted one result of this
//     exact tuple and looked at it.
//   * ≥1 cohort-admit      — the scale shape: a human admitted a verified
//     cohort of this tuple in one decision.
//   * ≥1 revert            — the recovery drill: the reversal path was
//     EXERCISED, not asserted. A recovery method nobody has run is a claim.
//
// Demotion is the one-click brake: gestured, recorded, and immediate —
// after it, the tuple is unpromoted until a human promotes again (the
// evidence record survives; distrust of the DECISION is not amnesia about
// the facts).
