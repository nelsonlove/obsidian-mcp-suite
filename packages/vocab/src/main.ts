// VAULT VOCABULARY — the controlled vocabulary's read surface as its own
// Obsidian plugin.
//
// Published to the Governor host through vault-mcp-api as four MCP tools:
//
//   vault_vocab_vocabularies    — enumerate the configured vocabulary sources
//   vault_vocab_resolve_term    — token → entry; path → that note's own terms
//   vault_vocab_validate_terms  — one note's frontmatter → findings
//   vault_vocab_list_vocabulary — the registered entries of one kind
//
// SATELLITE OF THE SUITE (suite-split design §6, row "Vocabulary provider |
// public optional | satellite"). Extracted out of the host at S7, following the
// quickadd-choices-compile pilot, vault-skills (S4), vault-triage (S5) and
// vault-crosssession (S6). Consequences of the publishing contract, each
// deliberate:
//
//   * THE KERNEL DID NOT COME WITH IT. `packages/core/src/vocab/` holds the
//     providers, the registry and the findings, because the host's conformance
//     rail is a SECOND consumer of exactly that code and always was. There is
//     no `src/kernel/` here and there must not be one — see tools.ts.
//   * THE PUBLISHED TOOL NAMES CHANGED. `obsidian_vocabularies` and its three
//     siblings are now `vault_vocab_*`, with the `obsidian_` prefix stripped
//     because it was the HOST's built-in namespace and not this module's name.
//     Recorded in CLAUDE.md with the reversal, not buried here.
//   * THE ALLOWLIST BOUNDARY MOVED TO THE HOST, and unlike every prior
//     satellite it is NOT uniform across the surface: two tools carry no path
//     argument and are blocked outright under an allowlist, one always carries
//     one and stays scoped, and one is blocked or scoped DEPENDING ON THE
//     ARGUMENTS OF THE INDIVIDUAL CALL. See tools.ts, and the settings tab,
//     which says so to the human.
//   * REFUSALS THROW; the host renders a thrown error's lowercase-snake `code`
//     as `Error [code]: message`. Two envelopes changed on purpose (the
//     argument-shape errors gained `invalid_argument`); the rest are
//     byte-compatible with the folded era.
//   * The host's queue, journal and kernel args still apply — external tools
//     ride the guarded registration path like every built-in, and an untrusted
//     `readOnly: true` claim means all four register as MUTATING.
//
// THIS PLUGIN NEEDS THE HOST, like the triage and crosssession satellites and
// unlike skills. It has no pane, no palette command and no ribbon: its entire
// surface is the four published tools. With Governor absent it loads, keeps and
// validates its settings, and does nothing — `publishTools` waits on the host's
// ready event and registers the moment a host appears.
//
// ONE ADOPTION, of an ARRAY. The difference from the three predecessors is the
// SHAPE of the source, not its fate: `settings.vocabularies` is a TOP-LEVEL
// host setting rather than a `modules.<id>.config` record, because it is a list
// of structured instances the host's scalar manifest-field renderer could not
// express. Its fate is the ordinary one — the host stops reading it, and the
// host's bespoke editor for it was removed at this extraction. It is still
// DECLARED and DEFAULTED there deliberately, as the adoption source, so that
// deleting it cannot destroy a user's configuration before this plugin has read
// it. Fully argued in settings.ts.
//
// RE-PUBLISHING ON CONFIG CHANGE, as in the triage and crosssession
// satellites. `ctx.getVocabularies` is a thunk read PER CALL, so the handlers
// always see the live rows — but the host SNAPSHOTS a published spec's schema
// and description when it registers it, and the descriptions are what an agent
// reads to decide whether to call a tool at all. Disposing and re-publishing on
// every settings write is what restores the per-connection freshness the module
// had. (Today none of the four descriptions interpolates a configured value.
// The rule still applies: `vocabularies` is precisely the tool that ENUMERATES
// the configured rows, so its description is one edit away from wanting them,
// and re-publishing costs nothing.)
