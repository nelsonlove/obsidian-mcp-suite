// drift-view.ts — the drift panel's cross-reference (Stage C of the
// jd-dashboard fold): which findings from a conformance run are (a) produced
// by the scheme pack and (b) NEW per the ratchet (not already-accepted
// debt), with full human-readable `detail` recovered and grouped by check —
// mirroring the original jd-dashboard drift panel's grouping by issue type
// (its own `wrong-folder`/`duplicate-id`/etc. naming doesn't survive the
// port; this groups by the current scheme pack's own `check` codes instead:
// misfiled/duplicate_address/malformed_name/unaddressed/name_colon/
// name_trailing_space — see kernel/scheme/provider.ts's SchemeFinding).
//
// `RatchetResult.newKeys` is a list of finding KEYS (the `(script, check,
// target, kind)` 4-tuple, stringified) — not full Finding objects, so it
// carries no `detail` a human could read. The cross-reference here is: build
// a key -> Finding map from the run's OWN `findings` (scoped to the scheme
// pack only), then look up each new key in that map. A newKey with no match
// (produced by some OTHER pack) is silently skipped — this view only ever
// wants the scheme pack's slice.
//
// Pure — no obsidian import, no I/O — operates on an already-computed
// conformance run (cli.ts's `runConformance` return shape: `findings` +
// `ratchet`). The live, in-process call path (matching the ALREADY-SHIPPED
// `obsidian_conformance_debt` tool's pattern, not a new one this fold had to
// invent) lives in the Obsidian adapter, mcp/obsidian-drift-source.ts.
