// packs/vocab.ts — the vocab rule pack: adapts the vocabulary kernel's pure
// `noteVocabFindings` to the canonical Finding shape.
//
// The kernel it wraps moved to `@vault-mcp/core` at the read-tier satellite
// extraction (suite split, S7). This pack is why: it is the SECOND consumer of
// the vocabulary rule core, and it stays in the host while the four vocabulary
// TOOLS left for the `vault-vocab` satellite. Two consumers in two plugins is
// exactly the `queryBaseRows` shape, and it has the same forbidden answer —
// two copies of a rule core is how one vault gets two vocabularies — so the
// kernel was published rather than copied or stranded.
//
// Mapping (the frozen contract): a VocabFinding {code, token, path, detail}
// becomes { script: "vocab_findings", check: code, target: path, kind: token }.
// The token's CASE IS PRESERVED in the key: two distinct-case tokens on one
// note are distinct findings, so lower-casing them would collapse them to one
// ratchet key and could mask a genuinely-new violation (a ratchet must never
// silently drop a regression — false-NEW churn is safer than false-CARRIED).
// The finding logic is NOT re-implemented here — this only re-homes the output.
