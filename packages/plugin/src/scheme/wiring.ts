// Wiring for the scheme Inbox and Drift panes (jd-dashboard fold, Stages B
// and C). Both are read-only chrome: no MCP tool, no write capability, no
// gesture gate — the same trust boundary as Obsidian's own file explorer,
// which is why (unlike an MCP tool's `ctx.notes()`) the Inbox pane reads
// `app.vault` directly rather than going through the MCP path-visibility
// allowlist (guard.ts's `visiblePaths`). That allowlist bounds what an
// MCP-connected AGENT can reach; a human's own sidebar in their own Obsidian
// is not that boundary. (The Drift pane's equivalent — the conformance
// engine's own `excludedRoots` config — is handled inside `runConformance`
// itself, via `obsidian-drift-source.ts`; nothing extra needed here.)
//
// The Inbox pane DOES still respect a configured scheme instance's
// `excludedRoots`, though — that is a "what does this vault's addressing
// scheme consider live JD territory at all" judgment (config is not
// hardwired, Nelson's ruling — see tools-scheme.ts's callers of
// `excludeRoots`), independent of the agent-facing allowlist. A
// vault-relative folder an instance is configured to never resolve/list/
// claim (e.g. an archive tree reusing a live spine's addresses) should not
// show up as a "real" inbox here either. Excluded from every configured
// instance's union, not just one — with several instances configured
// differently, any of them saying "this isn't live JD territory" is reason
// enough to leave it out of a human-facing rollup, even though only one
// instance's grammar is what actually finds the inbox folders in the first
// place (inbox.ts's own regexes, JD-specific — see its header for why that
// isn't threaded through ScopeProvider itself).
//
// LIVE MOUNT/UNMOUNT (fixes governor#286, filed against the original,
// onload-only shape of this file): both views + ribbons register on a
// shared child `Component` (`plugin.addChild`) that `wireSchemePanes`
// returns — a live unmount is `plugin.removeChild(it)`, which detaches any
// open leaves, unregisters both view types, and removes both ribbon
// elements. This mirrors `governor/wiring/wiring.ts`'s `wireGovernance` exactly
// (the fix pattern #286 pointed at, itself from #200) — a plugin-toggle
// flip is no longer a "nothing happened until I reload" surprise, and
// disabling the module no longer leaves a registered view type + a live
// leaf pointing at a torn-down mount. Commands are the one piece that stays
// OUTSIDE the component: Obsidian's public API has no `removeCommand`, so
// (matching every other wiring file in this plugin — none live-unregisters
// a command) they register once, unconditionally, at onload, and each
// callback checks the CURRENT enabled state before activating — a stale
// command while the module is off shows a Notice instead of silently
// trying to open an unregistered view type.
