// id-migration.ts — the 0.12.0 plugin-id migration (`vault-mcp` → `governor`,
// issue #266): adopt the OLD plugin folder's data into the new plugin dir on
// first load.
//
// The old folder (`.obsidian/plugins/vault-mcp/`) holds everything that must
// not be lost: `data.json` (settings), `journal/` (the append-only write
// journal), `install-id.json`, the acceptance module's baseline store and
// acceptance log, cross-session receipts — whatever lives beside the plugin's
// own data. On load, BEFORE settings load and before the kernel opens the
// journal, the plugin moves that folder's CONTENTS (adapter `rename`, an fs
// rename on desktop — atomic per entry, no copy) into its own dir, then
// leaves a `MIGRATED.md` marker in the old folder. The old folder itself is
// NOT deleted — a human removes it after live verification.
//
// Safety posture, in order:
//   - PLAN before touching anything (planFolderMigration is pure + fixture-
//     tested); the plan either skips, aborts, or names every move up front.
//   - The old plugin's CODE artifacts (main.js, manifest.json, styles.css)
//     never move — they would overwrite the new plugin's own code.
//   - If ANY move target already exists on the new side, the whole migration
//     ABORTS loudly and moves nothing (never overwrite; never half-adopt an
//     ambiguous state).
//   - Idempotent: the marker (or an old folder with no data.json, or a new
//     dir that already has data.json) ⇒ skip.
//   - A failure must never fail the plugin load — the caller logs and
//     continues with a fresh state; the old folder is still intact.
