// Export-on-save trigger — the pure half of the skills GUI's save hook, ported
// verbatim from the standalone vault-skills plugin (obsidian/src/export-trigger.ts)
// as part of the GUI fold (#82 residuals). Obsidian-free by construction, so the
// debounce coalescing and the change-relevance predicate are unit-testable
// outside the Obsidian runtime (see tests/skills-gui.test.mjs).
//
// Renaming a skill/agent/policy note makes Obsidian emit a *burst* of metadataCache
// "changed" events — the file rename itself, plus a cascaded `[[wikilink]]` rewrite in
// every child note whose `parent:` pointed at the old name. Exporting on each event would
// validate a half-rewritten tree: a child's `parent` link still resolves to the pre-rename
// basename (now missing), so the transform reports a spurious `unresolved parent` error and
// drops the child from the output. Debouncing collapses the burst into a single export once
// the cache has settled and every cascaded link rewrite is done, so validation always runs
// against the consistent post-rename tree.
